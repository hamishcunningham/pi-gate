<h1 class="cow-title-heading">A Flood in the Basement</h1>

<p>There's a poltergeist who lives in my basement. Either that, or I've had three
completely coincidental pipe failures in the space of a couple of years. The
last leak had such a high flow rate that if I hadn't wandered past in the
morning and wondered what that hissing noise was we would have had a brand new
swimming pool by the evening. The most worrying thing was that the leak came
from a pipe joint that was brand new a year ago (and not fitted by me, either,
but by a skilled professional<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>).</p>

<p>So I decided I needed a bit of long-term plumbing reassurance in the form of a
water alarm that will send me an SMS text message whenever things get wetter
than expected under the house. With a Pi and an alarm circuit like
<a class="cow-url" href="#parent-alarm">our parent alarm</a> this turns out to be a nice project.</p>

<p>Materials used:</p>
<ul>
<li>as per the parent alarm, minus the pressure pad</li>
<li>a simple mobile phone with USB cable, or a network-connection and an account
  on an SMS web service</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick here is to find a way to sense the presence of moisture. As water
conducts electricity we can do this using a variation on one of our
<a class="cow-url" href="#switches">switching circuits</a>: we'll run a length of two-core wire through
all the areas where we expect flooding and strip each core so that a flood
would connect the two cores together.</p>

<p>To decide on the values for the circuit that we'll use to connect to the Pi,
we need to test the resistance of the water connections using a multimeter; it
turns out that we have something between 20k and 50k ohms when the bare wire
is immersed. When the wire is dry (hopefully the long-term average!) the
resistance will be infinite (like an open switch). We also should expect that
the wires may touch (if someone steps on them and presses them together, for
example), so we also have to cater for a 0 ohms resistance. To deal with these
possibilities we'll use a 1k limiting resistor and a 100k pull down resistor
like this:
<br> <a class="cow-url" href="https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/at8v7f/water-sensor-raspberry-pi/"><img src="water-sensor-raspberry-pi.svg" alt="water sensor" width="500"></a> <br>
Here's what happens in our three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the wire is dry, R1 acts as an infinite resistance, and pin 11 (which
  we set in input mode) is pulled low via R2 and R3.</li>
<li>When the wire is wet, R1's resistance will be some way lower than that of R3
  (the pull down resistor) and so pin 11 will be pulled high.</li>
<li>If the wires are shorted R1's resistance will be close to zero, but we will
  not draw too much current from the Pi because of the presence of R2.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code to read from our water sensor is very simple: <tt>gpio mode 0 in</tt> sets
things up, and <tt>gpio read 0</tt> takes a reading. When things get wet (or there's
a short circuit) the read statement will return 1; otherwise it will return 0.</p>
