Learn When You're Young

Learn when you're young, remember when you're old.

When I was 16 or so I was totally obsessed by electronics of one sort or
another. (Ok, not _totally_; there was also space in there for thinking about
food and about one other subject which I'll leave as an exercise for the
reader.) I particularly remember a project that put an FM radio in a TicTac
box -- kind of like this beautiful

...only in a %(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_Tac, Tic Tac) box.

Heady stuff. (Ok, not as heady as the third category of 16-year-old obsession,
but still I used to spend hours pouring over a hot Maplin catalogue planning
my next foray into the tantalising world of transistors (or trannies),
tantalum capacitors, thin film resistors and the like%footnote(It was only
much much later that some of this terminology became intriguingly ambiguous.
If you don't know what I mean then please stay that way; if you do know, then
you're obviously as twisted as I am -- please send me a donation of â‚¬253.50 as
a penance.).)

Fast forward ahem years (ok -- 32, to be precise). As part of a
ground-breaking excursion to the very frontiers of human knowledge (otherwise
known as %(http://pi.gate.ac.uk)) I'm building circuits, figuring out which
combinations of components will solve a particular problem, prototyping them
virtually on %(https://www.circuitlab.com/, CircuitLab), prototyping them in
hardware on a breadboard, and, finally, soldering up "production prototypes"
on a stripboard. All good clean family fun, and useful to boot. (Thanks,
%(http://www.raspberrypi.org/, Raspberry Pi), for making all this possible!)

A lot of the skills and knowledge that I'm using is stuff that I haven't used
for the intervening thirty-odd years -- but they're still there. What you
learn when you're young, and what you learn when you're _interested_, stays
with you. It's a neural plasticity thing.

An upshot of all this, is that putting together a simple circuit board on a
Friday afternoon (instead of doing what I'm paid for, ahem) is a whole lot of
fun. And the pictures are almost as interesting as Category Three (this may
also be an age thing). Do let me know if you agree... here they
