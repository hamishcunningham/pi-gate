Help! My Toast is Burning!

No matter how much you love your Pi, some time or other you will inevitably be
forced to leave it behind while you do something boring like go to work, or
listen to your parents bang on about the need to get qualified, or another of
those little annoyances that life seems so full of. If your Pi is
%(/posts/2013/04/11/sensing-and-responding/, running a sensor) that you need
to be kept in touch with, then you need a way of getting your Pi to notify you
when something important happens. %(/pages/about.html#hamish, Hamish) uses the
%(/pages/basics.html#flood-alarm, flood alarm) to keep a check on some dodgy
plumbing in his basement, for example, and needs to know PDQ if the house
starts to fill up with cold wet stuff.

Our latest tutorial takes us through three options for telling the outside
world about Stuff Going On from your Pi:

# via SMS text message to your phone, using %(/pages/notipi.html#bulk-sms,
  a web service)
# via SMS text message to your phone, using %(/pages/notipi.html#nokia-sms, a
  phone) attached to the Pi
# via a %(/pages/notipi.html#pi-twitter, Twitter post)

Happy notipifications â˜º
