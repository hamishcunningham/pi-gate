Every night %(http://gate.ac.uk/hamish, Hamish) creeps out from
under a rock in the basement of the %(http://www.shef.ac.uk/, University of

an open hardware wannabe with Pi pretensions.

He's working on tutorial materials for various Pi-based projects on

%(http://www.cfpm.org/~peter/, Pete) is an old school electronics hacker and
AI boffin with an unusual taste in household applicances -- 
he's working %(piroomba.html, on a hoover he can talk to). (Perhaps so it
can't run away in the middle of the conversation?!)

%(http://design-4-learning.blogspot.com/, Helen) is an eLearning guru
who's working on filling the skills gap between the UK's ambitions to replace

other.

is a PhD student in Civil Engineering, which he says is quite similar

Fred wants a quadcopter for his next birthday.
