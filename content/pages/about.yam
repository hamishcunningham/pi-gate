%(http://www.cfpm.org/~peter/, Pete) is an old school electronics hacker and
AI boffin with an unusual taste in household applicances -- 
he's working %(piroomba.html, on a hoover he can talk to). (Perhaps so it
can't run away in the middle of the conversation?!)

Anne is an eLearning guru
who's working on filling the skills gap between the UK's ambitions to replace
word processing with something actually worth knowing on the one hand, and the
ability of our schools to start teach computing at very short notice on the
other.

is a PhD student in Civil Engineering, which he says is quite similar

Fred wants a quadcopter for his next birthday.
