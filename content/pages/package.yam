%1 Introduction: the Good Old Days

Twenty-odd years ago I worked for a company building accounting and stock
control systems for manufacturing businesses. I started as a general gopher,
tea-maker and minor bug fixer on big old behemoths written in a language
called COBOL -- which some people claimed was a "common business-oriented
language" but I was sure stood for "computer operators are boring and
obviously lobotomised". Customers would phone up and say "we've got a new
invoice format, can you change the report printer to fit?", and I would spend
a day or two hunched over a stack of continuous paper (the type with
%br %(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bound_computer_printout.agr.jpg,
%image(images/continuous-paper.jpg, Old-style printer paper, 408, 599)) %br
perforated edges) with a special measuring ruler figuring out how many spaces
to leave between the date and the address, and the like.

The low point of this phase was four days of my life spent chasing a rounding
error in an invoicing program that resulted in a 2 pence error on a Â£10,000
invoice. I told the boss that I was happy to pay them the 2 pence every time
it happenned if only I could stop leafing through that 100-page COBOL
monstrosity%footnote(The program is engraved on my soul -- it was called
SOP-1, for Sales Order Processing, and it had grown and grown far beyond the
ability of a neophyte like myself to ever understand. Trial and error was my
only weapon, and it was a definite trial with lots of errors.), but he didn't
think that was a great customer relations strategy.

The company was starting to move into Unix-based delivery platforms (System V
was the new thing back then; and a whole business would run on a tiny
mini-computer!). I was lucky enough to get my hands dirty with the new tech
and learnt an awful lot in short space of time. It is a testament to the power
and success of the Unix paradigm that I'm still using many of these skills
today -- C programming, shell scripting, systems administration and the like.

One of my tasks at the time was to package and distribute versions of our
systems to customer machines. I used a program called UUCP (Unix-to Unix copy)
over dial-up modem links to push new updates onto machines out on site (and,
cheekily, used to get the customer machine to phone us back so that the
lengthy upload process would happen on their phone bill, not ours!). Things
are a little simpler now: someone invented a thing called the
Internet...%footnote(The Internet, of course, mostly runs on Unix-based
operating systems, as does your Pi, Android phones, and Apple computers.)

The job of packaging and distribution continues to be important, though, and
below I'll describe the mechanisms used for the Raspberry Pi's _Raspbian_
operating system.
