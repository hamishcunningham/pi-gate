Pre-Production MoPi Boards

TODO
- details of pre-production stuff, whatever else is on the stack, and revision
  of delivery schedule
- then post an update linking here


The boards (without the wiring connector or the GPIO connector or the power
switch)

Notes: _One detail have to be carefully considered however: when mains drops,
Pi must be powered "immediately" to keep running. There are no big capacitors
on Pi's PCB to keep consumption of 300 - 500 mA without power. The mostly
secured way is MoPi to be always on monitoring Pi's 5V, something that the new
PCB should be able to do. When monitored 5V goes down "a little" MoPi will
enable its 5V stabilizer taking over the Pi's power. Based on above why not
try the circuit attached. When there is mains, the charger is generating e.g.
+12V DC and the relay's coil is energized. The contact is switched to the
normal open position and is passing +12V to charge the batteries. When mains
drops, the relay is switching to the normal closed position and charging will
stop. MoPi is powered all the time._
