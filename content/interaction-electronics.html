<h1 class="cow-title-heading">Interaction Electronics</h1>

<p>The Pi is a <em>general purpose</em> computer. It runs <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a><span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>, which
is an operating system used in satellites and phones, desktops and tablets,
supercomputers and set-top boxes. It has graphics capabilities good enough for
full HD video, plus computational power and memory sufficient to run a web
browser or an office productivity suite. It has a good selection of standard
interconnectivity options (including ethernet, HDMI, stereo analogue sound,
and USB). Packing all of this into a very cheap, low power and low footprint
(made in the UK!) device is truly game changing.</p>

<p>Another game changer with the Pi is its ability to connect directly to
electronic circuits that can take readings from the physical environment and
trigger actions in that environment (and/or over the network). When you couple
a general purpose computing device with the Pi's extremely accessible
interaction electronics all sorts of projects become so simple that everyone
from school kids (Raspberry Pirates!) to absent-minded academic types can
achieve them within a short space of time. This combination of general purpose
computer with accessible electronics is a radical development.</p>

<p>Below we'll give <b>an introduction to sensing and responding with the Pi</b>, and
detail some projects that can be completed in a few hours with a few pounds'
worth of materials.</p>

<p>The Pi's connections for getting data from sensors and for activating external
gizmos are called <em>general purpose input output</em> pins, or GPIO pins. The
simplest of these will either sense or output a small voltage (3.3 volts, not
enough to give you a shock!). We can connect simple electronic circuits to
these pins to get the Pi interacting with its environment.</p>

<p>The Pi's GPIO pins are accessible via various software packages, which frees
us from the tyranny of the keyboard/mouse/screen combination and allows us to
program software to read from sensors and respond to changing conditions.</p>

<p>Here are some example projects that will teach you how to couple the Pi's GPIO
pins with easy-to-build interaction electronics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="cow-url" href="#hello-world">controlling an LED</a> (hello world!) and reading from a switch</li>
<li><a class="cow-url" href="#parent-alarm">hide! my parents are coming!</a> (a simple alarm system)</li>
<li><a class="cow-url" href="#flood-alarm">a flood alarm</a> with text message notifications to your phone</li>
</ul>

<p>These projects use a prototyping tool called a breadboard to get started
quickly and easily. For introductions to this way of working, and to hacker
electronics in general, see the <a class="cow-url" href="#electronics">electronics section</a> of the
<a class="cow-url" href="#resources">resources chapter</a>.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b>: it is possible fry your Pi and other nasties by doing this type
of thing &mdash; please see <a class="cow-url" href="#warning">this warning</a> for details.</p>
