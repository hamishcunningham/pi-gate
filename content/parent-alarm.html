<h1 class="cow-title-heading">Parent Alarm</h1>

<p>Parents &mdash; they're quite handy for doing the shopping and making breakfast and
the like, but they do tend to get in the way, don't they? And even perfectly
innocent teenage activities like building a particle accelerator in your
bedroom can easily lead to awkward questions and family misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Let's use a Pi and a pressure mat to give an early warning of parental feet in
the corridor.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>bell wire or similar</li>
<li>a pressure pad sensor</li>
<li>a breadboard</li>
<li>resistors (270&Omega;, 1k&Omega;, 10k&Omega;)</li>
<li>green and red LEDs</li>
<li>link wire</li>
<li>jumper cables</li>
<li>a multimeter (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first part is easy: we just replace the switch in the <a class="cow-url" href="#switches">reading
from switches</a> circuit with a pressure mat<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>. Here's an example
mat:</p>

<p><img src="pressure-mat.jpg" alt="a pressure mat" width="500"></p>

<p>This works just like a switch &mdash; there are two wires to connect to, and when a
heavy object (e.g. a parent) stands on the mat the two wires are connected
(i.e. the resistance between them cycles between very high and very
low).<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote2"><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>
So we can use exactly the same circuit we used earlier for reading from a
switch and turning an LED on or off:</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/886nta/sensing-from-switch-and-driving-led-raspberry-pi/"><img src="sensing-from-switch-and-driving-led.svg" alt="switch and LED" width="550"></a></p>

<p>One limitation of this circuit is that if Mum should happen to pop in one day
and zap 50,000 volts across the Pi's GPIO pins the poor thing is unlikely to
remain enthusiastic about driving our indicator LED &mdash; but we won't actually
know that anything has changed, because as it stands there is no indication of
normal operation as opposed to the various possible failure conditions. The
next circuit addresses this limitation by adding another LED that is lit up
when the pressure pad is <em>not</em> being stood on. That way we'll have an
indicator of what state the system is in for both the &quot;everything's ok&quot; and
the &quot;run and hide!&quot; conditions, so we'll immediately know if we've forgotten
to switch the thing on, or if one of the LEDs has died, or etc.</p>

<p>The circuit: <br>
<a class="cow-url" href="https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/56x6hf/an-alarm-with-two-leds-raspberry-pi/"><img src="an-alarm-with-two-leds.svg" alt="alarm with two LEDs" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The breadboard for this circuit looks like this: <br></p>

<!--% NOTE: this is actually wired up with the LEDs on pins 11 and 13 and the-->

<!--% switch on 12, or similar; we just ignore this in the text, but really we-->

<!--% should redo the breadboard and the local-bin/water-alarm.sh code-->


<p><img src="bbd-with-mat.jpg" alt="breadboard with pressure mat" width="500"></p>

<p>The green LED runs when the mat is <em>not</em> being stood on, indicating that all
is fine; the yellow LED (red would also be a good colour) lights up when it's
time to hide the particle accelerator and pretend to be doing the homework.</p>

<p>A closer look:</p>

<p><img src="bbd-with-mat-detail.jpg" alt="breadboard with pressure mat detail" width="500"></p>

<p>We need a new program to drive the extra LED (which is on Wiring Pi's GPIO 2,
connected on physical header pin 13). In Unix shell script a suitable
program is this:</p>

<pre>
gpio mode 0 in
gpio mode 1 out
gpio mode 2 out

while :
do
  if [ `gpio read 0` == 1 ]
  then
    gpio write 1 1
    gpio write 2 0
  else
    gpio write 1 0
    gpio write 2 1
  fi
  sleep 1
done
</pre>

<p>Here the two LEDs are controlled on GPIO 1 and 2, and as before we're reading
the input on GPIO 0. When someone stands on the pressure mat the input is 1,
and the first branch of the <tt>if</tt> statement will turn the first LED on and the
second one off; otherwise the reverse will happen. So of our two LEDs, one
will indicate safety and the other an alarm state.</p>

<p>Job done.</p>
