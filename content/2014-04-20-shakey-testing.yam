Shakey Testing

Ok, so it was raining solidly for the second day of our (working) holiday, but
what the hell -- I was tucked up in bed, and The Little Monster was still
asleep at gone 9 local time. Life was fine. And then I tried to sit up, and
the world started spinning. Hmmm. Not so fine.

Labyrinthitis is a murky syndrome involving the tiny hairs in your inner ear
that allow us to balance. If there's a change in the liquid that activates
them, then all sorts of wierd and wonderful things can happen -- including
vertigo. A frequent result, apparently, is projectile oral expulsion of
whatever you've been scoffing recently -- see for example
%(http://www.pcarter.com.au/books/ride-like-hell-and-youll-get-there/, Paul
Carter's account) -- but lucky for me I didn't go through that stage.

I do feel somewhat wobbly, though, and testing new versions of the MoPi
firmware from Lubo has been a bit tricky for the last few days...

All part of life's rich tapestry, no doubt. Onwards.

%2 Enabling I2C

Now that MoPi uses I2C as its communication mechanism, we have to enable this
in the SimBaMon package. Here's how we do it (as described in various places,
including
%(https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c,
on Adafruit)):

- add lines ^i2c-bcm2708^ and ^i2c-dev^ in ^/etc/modules^
- comment out the line ^blacklist i2c-bcm2708^ in
  ^/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist^ (if it exists)
