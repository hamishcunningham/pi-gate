<p>Although all the voltages we're working with here are too small to hurt a big
lump of a thing like a human being, it <em>is</em> perfectly possible to destroy your
Pi by making connections to the wrong pins! It is also theoretically possible
to create enough heat to start a fire (probably only if you pile something
extremely flammable on top of it all and wait a week or so, but nevertheless
please be warned).</p>

<p>The Pi has very low power consumption, but if you're an electronics newcomer
(or even just dopey and error-prone like me) the safe thing to do is always
power down whenever you're not working on your rig. And to <b>proceed with
caution</b>!</p>

<p><b>Soldering</b> brings with it its own set of potential gotchas of course. There's
a clue to this in the involvement of a hot iron, molten metal and heated wires
&mdash; we leave it as an exercise for the reader as to what happens when you touch
something really hot with a part of your anatomy. If in doubt, don't try this
at home.</p>

<p>Finally, please note that it is quite possible that these paragraphs contain
nuts. Why don't sharks eat lawyers? Professional courtesy.</p>
