Last Chance to Back Mobile Pi Kickstarter!

Our MoPi power management board for the Pi has had a fantastic response
%(http://kck.st/1gK5U3t, on Kickstarter) (a big *thanks* to all our backers!).

This weekend is your last chance to back the project, which ends next Tuesday
(11th March 2014).

MoPi is mobile and 24/7 power for the Pi. On your bike, up a tree, or for your
home server:

- multiple inputs: standard batteries, car power sockets, old laptop supplies,
  solar panels, ...
- hot-swap power replacement without stopping work
- shutdown the Pi cleanly when batteries discharge
- integrated on/off switch
- UPS (uninterruptible power) when using both batteries and mains
- on-board LED indicators and on-Pi notifications

And it even fits in the Pibow (and other popular cases)...  More at

During the crowdfunding campaign we've unlocked these stretch goals: screw
terminals, stackable headers, remoting pads, self-resetting fuse, two-way
communication, remote power-off, 3.3V supply, timer-based wake-up.

Next up: taking delivery of the 3rd set of prototype boards (the PCBs are on
order), implementing the new functions and testing, testing, testing... Then
volume production and delivery.
