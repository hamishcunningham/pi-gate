  - Pi Model C, Sneak Preview
    - Ok, I lied, this isn't really a preview of the model C, whatever and
      whenever that will be. But we do know that the Pi foundation is going to
      move on -- as Eben Upton said last month ...
    - We've put together %(pages/hardware.html, a review of other single board
      systems) that cover some of the same ground as the Pi -- perhaps there
      are some clues here about what the next generation may look like?
    - Another clue from that interview with Eben: `We’re teaching kids to
      program a single core processor. We’re actually teaching kids about what
      computers used to be.' Multicore Pi, anyone?
