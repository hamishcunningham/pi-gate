<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Introduction: Catch-22</h1>

<p>There's a familiar problem when you work with a Pi without a monitor &mdash; how to
log in?</p>

<p>You've plugged your Pi onto a perfectly ethernet connection, the operating
system has worked its magic and the LINK LED is merrily blinking away to tell
you that there's traffic on the wire... but you don't know the address! (Or:
you've got a USB WiFi dongle, and an available network, but your Pi doesn't
know the passphrase.)</p>

<p>You need to IP address so you can log in (e.g. via <tt>ssh</tt>), but you need to log
in to find out the IP address.
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)">Catch-22</a>!</p>

<p>This page discusses various solutions to the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>using the Pi'd status LED to <a class="cow-url" href="#blink">blink the IP number</a></li>
<li>writing the IP address <a class="cow-url" href="#file">to file</a> on the SD card</li>
<li>using the <a class="cow-url" href="#pagekite">PageKite</a> proxy system</li>
</ol>

<p>We'll also note <a class="cow-url" href="#other">some other approaches</a> at the end (e.g. sending an
SMS).</p>

<p>The rest of this section describes how to <a class="cow-url" href="#ifconfig">find the Pi's IP
address</a> which will then be used by all the other methods, and also how to get
your Pi to <a class="cow-url" href="#wifi">connect to a WiFi network</a> without logging in.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="ifconfig"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1.1. </span>Getting the IP Address via <tt>ifconfig</tt></h2>

<p>All methods for informing you of the IP address require a way to get that
address in the first place. For this we'll use the <tt>ifconfig</tt> command, which
stands for &quot;interface configuration&quot;, the interfaces in question being the
wired and wireless network ports on the Pi.</p>

<p>If you open a terminal on your Pi and run <tt>ifconfig</tt> you'll see output
something like this:</p>

<pre>
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:00:eb:73:00:9a
          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1

          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)

          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:75 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:75 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:10493 (10.2 KiB)  TX bytes:10493 (10.2 KiB)

          inet addr:192.168.68.189  Bcast:192.168.68.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:856 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:499 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:122622 (119.7 KiB)  TX bytes:58536 (57.1 KiB)
</pre>

<p>This describes three network interfaces:</p>

<ol>
<li>the wired link, <tt>eth0</tt></li>
<li>the &quot;loopback&quot; link, which is a virtual interface pointing back at the local
  machine (or <em>localhost</em>)</li>
<li>the wireless link, if one is connected, <tt>wlan0</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>Each link may (or may not) have an IP address. In the above, the wired link is
not connected so has no address. The loopback link always has the same address
&mdash; <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>, and is not interesting in this context as we can't use that
address for logging in to our Pi. So in this case we're interested in the IP
address given for <tt>wlan0</tt>, which is <tt>192.168.68.189</tt>.</p>

<p>Here's a shell command which takes the output of <tt>ifconfig</tt>, picks out the
first non-local IP address and splits it into it's four number groups:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
MYIP=`ifconfig |grep -v 127.0.0.1 |grep 'addr:' | head -1 |\
  sed -e 's,.*addr:,,' -e 's, .*,,' -e 's,\., ,g'`
echo $MYIP
</pre>The two <tt>grep</tt>s filter out</p>

<ul>
<li>the localhost address (using the <tt>-v</tt> flag to exclude all matching lines),
  and then</li>
<li>all lines that don't match the &quot;addr:&quot; pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>We use <tt>head -1</tt> to select only the first address. Finally, the <tt>sed</tt> (stream
editor) command removes the &quot;addr:&quot; part of the line, then everything after
the first space, and then changes all the &quot;.&quot;s to spaces.</p>

<p>The output will be something like <tt>192 168 68 189</tt>. Now let's see how we can
communicate that to the Pi's user.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="wifi"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1.2. </span>Connecting to WiFi</h2>

<p>Another conundrum hits us when we've got a WiFi dongle connected to the Pi and
there's a network available, but no way to tell the Pi about the network SSID
and passphrase.</p>

<p>The solution is to take the SD card to another machine, mount the filesystem
and add the network details to the file
<tt>/etc/wpa<span class="cow-escape">_</span>supplicant/wpa<span class="cow-escape">_</span>supplicant.conf</tt>. The simple cases look like this
(for WPA):</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
network={
  ssid=&quot;MyWifi&quot;
  psk=&quot;1133557799&quot;
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
</pre>...or this (for WEP):</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
network={
  ssid=&quot;MyOtherWifi&quot;
  key_mgmt=NONE
  auth_alg=OPEN
  wep_key0=2244668800
}
</pre>One very good policy, if you have a phone or a laptop that can create a wifi
hotspot, is to put those details into your Pi's WPA config &mdash; then whenever
you need to log into the Pi you can fire up your phone's network and your Pi
will connect automagically. (A handy command to see what the connection is
getting up to when logged in is this: <tt>wpa<span class="cow-escape">_</span>cli status</tt>.)</p>

<p>Now let's look at how to get the IP from the Pi without logging in.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="blink"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>Blink the Status LED</h1>

<p>The Pi has a set of LEDs in one corner of the board that convey various
messages:</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/status-led.jpg" alt="The status LED" width="500" height="498"> <br>
(Image from:
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.rpiblog.com/2012/12/raspberry-pi-status-indicator-led-info.html">RPIBlog</a>.)</p>

<p>One good option for IP address discovery is to make the status LED (which is
marked either &quot;ACT&quot; &mdash; as in the image above &mdash; or &quot;OK&quot; depending on which
revision you have). The question then, is &quot;who's going to run the code to
blink the LED?&quot; I've written a daemon to do this &mdash; the code is
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/blinkip">available on GitHub</a>, and described in the rest of this section.</p>

<p>To access the Pi's status LED, we use the <tt>/sys/class</tt> tree, which makes the
hardware available as <tt>leds/led0/brightness</tt>. We can define functions to turn
the LED on and off like this<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote1"><sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></span>:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  LED=/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

  bright() { echo 1 &gt;$LED; }
  dark()   { echo 0 &gt;$LED; }
</pre>And here are a couple of utility functions to pause for various durations:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  pause() { dark; sleep 2.5; }
  shortpause() { dark; sleep 1; }
</pre>We'll use these functions to blink the IP address, along with three
conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>each IP number group is separated from the rest by a period of rapid
  blinking (which also signals the start and end of the whole sequence)</li>
<li>each digit is blinked as a series of bright periods (of about a third of a
  second each)</li>
<li>when we have a zero we represent it as ten (so that we can distinguish zero
  from the pauses between digits)</li>
</ul>

<p>These conventions are implemented like this:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-base">
  rapid()  {                                # rapid blinking function
    i=0
    while [ $i -lt 15 ]                     # 15 rapid blinks
    do
      bright; sleep 0.05; dark; sleep 0.05  # 5 hundredths of a second
      i=`expr $i + 1`                       # increment the loop index
    done
  }

  showdigit() {                             # individual digit function
    d=$1
    [ $d = 0 ] &amp;&amp; d=10                      # show &quot;0&quot; as &quot;10&quot;
    for((b=0; b&lt;$d; b++))                   # loop from 0 to the digit value
    do
      bright; sleep 0.3; dark; sleep 0.4
    done
  }
</pre>Putting it all together, here's the function to blink the whole IP address:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  blink() {
    rapid; rapid                            # blink rapidly to start with

    for block in $1 $2 $3 $4                # cycle through each address block
    do
      numdigits=${#block}
      for ((i=0; i &lt; $numdigits; i++))      # for each digit
      do
        pause
        showdigit ${block:$i:1}             # call showdigit on 1 character
      done

      shortpause; rapid
      shift
    done
  }
</pre>We then call the function like this (using the code from <a class="cow-url" href="#ifconfig">the
section on finding the IP</a>):</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  MYIP=`ifconfig |grep -v 127.0.0.1 |grep 'addr:' | head -1 |\
    sed -e 's,.*addr:,,' -e 's, .*,,' -e 's,\., ,g'`
  blink $MYIP
</pre>The complete code
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/blob/master/blinkip/blinkip.sh">is here</a>.</p>

<p><a name="installing"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.1. </span>Installing and Running</h2>

<p>There's one final problem, though &mdash; who is going to call this program if I
can't log in?! The answer is a <em>daemon</em>, a system-level service which gets run
during operating system startup. We implemented one of these for our
<a class="cow-url" href="/pages/mopi.html">MoPi battery monitor</a>, and we've done the same for BlinkIP. You
can install it from our Ubuntu-hosted package archive &mdash; see
<a class="cow-url" href="/pages/basics.html#installing">the installation guide</a> for details.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="file"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>Write a File to the SD Card</h1>

<p>Another option is to have the IP address written to a file on your Pi's SD
card, then to shutdown and read the file on another device (if you have one
handy with a card reader). The BlinkIP code described in the previous section
also does this for you.</p>

<p>It isn't quite as reliable as the other methods, because it is possible that
the IP address will change when you put the card back in the Pi and boot up
again.</p>

<p>BlinkIP puts the IP data into <tt>/home/pi/.blink-ip.txt</tt> by default.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="pagekite"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>Run PageKite</h1>

<p>Here be dragons! <b>Please read this <a class="cow-url" href="#warning">warning first!!!</a>.</b></p>

<p>Now here's a thing &mdash; it turns out that using the miraculous capabilities of
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">the Secure Shell</a> (SSH) and the
fiendishly clever <a class="cow-url" href="https://pagekite.net/">PageKite system</a> we can pretty much
avoid all this blinking business and make it easy and convenient to log in to
the Pi from anywhere, any time &mdash; and Santa Claus will pop round to give you
an enormous present and a kiss on the nose every couple of days<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote2"><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>This miracle is brought to you by a <a class="cow-url" href="https://pagekite.net/company/">couple of
idealistic Icelandic folk</a> who hold the unfashionable opinion that it might be
a bad idea for Facebook, Google and the like to
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/the-public-private-surveillance-partnership.html">pipe all our data wholesale into Mordor</a> so that spotty young spies at the NSA
or GCHQ can use it to stalk their chosen love interest or persecute those
whose political opinions they disagree with.</p>

<p>A big problem with moving away from the cloud services of the mega-corps is
that much of the time most of the machines we own are behind firewalls,
network address translation (NAT) gateways and the like, and so we can't
easily serve files or make connections. PageKite solves this problem by
providing a secure proxy service. A tiny amount of data is stored on a server
in Iceland<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote3"><sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span> (which now has some of the
best Internet legal protection in the world, incidentally) &mdash; the rest of it
stays safe on your own machines, and the spies just have to pick their noses
and twiddle their thumbs instead.</p>

<p>I first used PageKite to get access to the <a class="cow-url" href="/pages/basics.html#flood-alarm">flood
alarm in my basement</a>, which is behind my home router and a NAT. It allows me
to log into that Pi by doing:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  ssh -l pi flooding.pagekite.me
</pre>Very nice.</p>

<p>PageKite isn't that easy to set up though &mdash; I'll finish this section with a
short guide to how I got SSH login to work.</p>

<p>First, head on over to <a class="cow-url" href="https://pagekite.net/">https://pagekite.net/</a> and get a kite (they operate a
&quot;<a class="cow-url" href="https://pagekite.net/signup/?more=bw">pay as you like</a>&quot; arrangement). We'll
refer to your kite as <tt>MY<span class="cow-escape">_</span>KITE<span class="cow-escape">_</span>NAME</tt> below.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.1. </span>Installing PageKite</h2>

<p>To install the system on your Pi, run these commands in a terminal:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">

  apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keys.gnupg.net AED248B1C7B2CAC3
  apt-get update
  apt-get install pagekite
</pre>You also need the <em>netcat</em>, or <tt>nc</tt> command installed if it isn't already.
This is a standard gizmo, so you can install it with:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  sudo apt-get install netcat

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
  pagekite --add 22 ssh:MY_KITE_NAME.pagekite.me
  pagekite --add 80 MY_KITE_NAME.pagekite.me
</pre>Edit <tt>/etc/pagekite.d/10<span class="cow-escape">_</span>account.rc</tt> and:</p>

<ul>
<li>replace &quot;NAME.pagekite.me&quot; with MY<span class="cow-escape">_</span>KITE<span class="cow-escape">_</span>NAME</li>
<li>replace &quot;YOURSECRET&quot; with the shared secret (available at

<p>We're using PageKite to make a remote service available from our Pi &mdash; this
means that a potential intruder can get in!</p>

<p>Don't ignore this: there are lots and lots and lots of people (and robots) out
there actively trying to subvert systems, and if you make an insecure machine
visible out there in the big bad world you are very likely to be hacked, with
all kinds of nasty consequences.</p>

<p>So, at the very least, make a strong password on your Pi: use 10 or 20
characters, upper case and lower case, punctuation and symbols. Even better,
set up your SSH server to only allow key-based login (do set up your key
<b>before</b> doing this!).</p>

<p>Linux is probably the most secure system in the world &mdash; but nothing is secure
if the user doesn't set things up properly.</p>

<p>You have been warned.</p>

<p>Robbie Wiggins has
<a class="cow-url" href="http://raspberrypihell.blogspot.com/2013/08/send-ip-info-on-boot-up.html">a nice script</a> to send a text message with the IP address on boot up.</p>

<p>It should also be very possible to Tweet your IP, e.g. using the
<a class="cow-url" href="/pages/notipi.html#pi-twitter">programmatic Twitter</a> code in our <a class="cow-url" href="/pages/notipi.html">Notifications</a> material.</p>

<p>Finally, if you're psychic, you don't need any of these methods &mdash; just put
your forehead close to the ethernet cable and listen for the magic numbers.</p>
