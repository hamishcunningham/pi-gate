<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Pi to Go!</h1>

<p>MoPi is mobile and 24/7 power for the Pi. On your bike, up a tree, or for your
home server: we've got you covered.</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/logo-heli-1.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/logo-heli-1-200x150.png" alt="MoPi Heli Logo" width="200" height="150"></a></p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple inputs &mdash; standard batteries, car power sockets, old laptop
  supplies, solar panels, and more... all attachable via standard screw
  terminals</li>
<li>hot-swap power replacement without stopping work</li>
<li>shutdown the Pi cleanly when batteries discharge</li>
<li>integrated on/off switch</li>
<li>usable as a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) by attaching both batteries
  and mains</li>
<li>on-board LED indicators and on screen linux system notifications</li>
<li>configuration of multiple battery chemistries and number of cells from a UI
  on the Pi</li>
<li>full API in Python, plus a shell-friendly command-line interface</li>
<li>stackable headers allowing connections of multiple boards at once (e.g. MoPi
  + XLoBorg, or MoPi + AirPi, or etc.).</li>
<li>PCB remoting pads for the power switch</li>
<li>self-resetting fuse for over-current protection</li>
<li>two-way communication via the I2C bus</li>
<li>remote power-off: tell MoPi to power down the Pi when logged-in remotely
  (after a clean shutdown, of course)</li>
<li>timer-based wake-up: tell MoPi what time you want your Pi to wakeup, then
  power it down and MoPi will boot the Pi as requested</li>
<li>3.3V supply mod: swap three resistors and supply 3.3V, overpowering the Pi's
  on-board regulator and saving the power that is dissipated there, for weight
  and battery life critical applications like ballooning</li>
<li>supports Pi models A, B and B+</li>
<li>wide input voltage range: 6.2V to 20V<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote2"><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></span></li>
</ul>

<p>And it even fits in the Pibow (and other well-known Pi cases):</p>

<ul>
<li>DO NOT plug MoPi onto your Pi while the Pi is powered up!</li>
<li>DO NOT touch electronic components when they're powered up &mdash; you may
  damage them, or burn your fingers!</li>
<li>AVOID handling circuit boards when charged with static!</li>
<li>ALWAYS read the small print on <em>all</em> components supplied with your MoPi</li>
<li>ALWAYS treat batteries and other power supplies with respect &mdash; if abused
  the energy they contain may surprise you in dangerous ways!</li>
<li>DO NOT feed MoPi to your dog, eat nuts if you're allergic to them, or lose
  your sense of humour.<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote3"><sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></span></li>

<p><a name="quick-install"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.2. </span>Installation and Use</h2>

<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.2.1."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.2.1. </span>Quick Start</h3>

<p>If you're in a hurry:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the battery monitoring software and shutdown:
  <ul>
  <li>sudo apt-get update</li>
  <li>sudo apt-get install simbamond</li>
  <li>sudo poweroff</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Connect your batteries to the MoPi</li>
<li>Attach the MoPi to your Pi and press the Power Button for 3 seconds</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/quickstart/schematic6.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/quickstart/schematic6-500x745.png" alt="Quick start guide" width="500" height="745"></a></p>

<p>For more details on each step, see below.</p>

<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.2.2."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.2.2. </span>Installing the Software</h3>

<p>As noted above, you can install the battery monitoring software like this:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>sudo apt-get update</li>
  <li>sudo apt-get install simbamond</li>
  </ul>

<p>(We assume you're using the <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian flavour</a> of
<a class="cow-url" href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> GNU Linux here.)</p>

<p>Occasionally this method may cause glitches (if you've a very old version of
the rest of the operating system installed, for example). The most cautious
recipe is to update your firmware and the operating system, then install the
MoPi software, and to reboot between each step:</p>

<ul>
<li>sudo apt-get update</li>
<li>sudo apt-get upgrade</li>
<li>sudo reboot</li>
<li>sudo rpi-update</li>
<li>sudo reboot</li>
<li>sudo apt-get install simbamond</li>
<li>sudo poweroff</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="no-mopi-warning"></a>
Note that if you're installing the software without MoPi attached, or without
power attached to MoPi, you will get a warning message<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote4"><sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></span>; just
ignore it at this point!</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.2.3."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.2.3. </span>Connecting the Power and the Pi</h3>

<p>Next connect one or more power supply to MoPi using the screw terminals on the
underside of the board. Then gently push fit MoPi onto your Raspberry Pi's
GPIO pins. Make sure you do this with the Raspberry Pi turned off, or you risk
a reset.</p>

<p>The components on the MoPi are as follows:</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/mopi-with-key-schematic.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/mopi-with-key-schematic-500x262.png" alt="Board connections schematic 1" width="500" height="262"></a></p>

<p>When connecting two power sources (e.g. two battery packs, or one solar panel
and one battery pack) the ground wires (-ve, typically black) both share the
middle connector on the screw terminals. The live wires (+ve, typically red)
then get one each of the other connectors. The lower of the supply connections
shown in the schematics corresponds to <em>source 1</em>; the other to <em>source 2</em>.</p>

<p>When you've connected your supplies, MoPi then fits onto the Pi as shown on
the right:</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/mopi-with-key-schematic-02.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/mopi-with-key-schematic-02-500x138.png" alt="Board connections schematic
2" width="500" height="138"></a></p>

<p>The charge level of each source is signalled by the two amber LEDs on the top
of the board, and the overall health of the supplies by a single
RGB<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote5"><sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></span> LED.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.2.4."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.2.4. </span>Turn On, Turn Off</h3>

<p>When the Pi is powered off, press the power button for 3 seconds to turn it
on.<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote6"><sup><a href="#footnote6">6</a></sup></span></p>

<p>When the Pi is powered on, press the power button for 3 seconds to turn it
off. This will shut the Pi down cleanly (which can take up to around 30
seconds). If you hold the power button down for 10 seconds, the power will
shut down immediately.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="bat-mgmt"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.3."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.3. </span>Choosing and Configuring Batteries (Etc.)</h2>

<p>The short story is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any power supply connected to the MoPi must be capable of at least 6.2V
  under load, and no more than 20V.</li>
<li>The MoPi must be configured correctly both to avoid damage to rechargeable
  batteries and to avoid unexpected shutdowns!</li>
</ul>

<p>How do I configure MoPi? There are 3 ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose one of the on-board defaults&mdash;easy peasy!</li>
<li>Use the Configuration Tool<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote7"><sup><a href="#footnote7">7</a></sup></span> on your Pi&mdash;straightforward.</li>
<li>Use the command-line interface, and/or edit the daemon config data
  on your Pi&mdash;advanced.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's take each of these in turn...</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="default-profiles"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.3.1."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.3.1. </span>Choosing Default Supply Profiles</h3>

<p>MoPi has two default supply profiles built-in:</p>

<ol>
<li>Non-rechargeable or non-battery supplies.</li>
<li>Eight NiMH AA rechargeable batteries.</li>
</ol>

<p>The default is #1, so that any supply can power the MoPi. To choose #2, you
need to remove the small jumper on the screw terminal side of the MoPi, either
completely or replaced on only one of the pins.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: when we supply MoPi with batteries we fit the jumper to choose profile
#2, that is so it matches NiMh the batteries we shipped!</p>

<p>You can see the jumper in this picture: the little black component sticking up

<p>If you're using a supply that doesn't match MoPi's two <a class="cow-url" href="#default-profiles">built-in profiles</a> you need to run a configuration utility on the Pi itself.
This will prompt you to enter details of the supply, then calculate
appropriate values to send to the board over I2C. It will also store the
config data and resend it to the board after reboots as necessary.</p>

<p>To start the configuration tool open a terminal and do:</p>

<pre>
sudo mopi
</pre>

<p>The tool operates in the same way as the Raspberry Pi's configuration tool
(<tt>raspi-config</tt>). Select the option to configure one or both of MoPi's
supplies, and then:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Type of supply</em>. This is one of <b>rechargeable battery</b>, <b>non-rechargeables</b>
  (like standard Alkaline batteries), or <b>non-battery</b> (like an AC adapter).</li>
<li><em>Number of cells</em>. This is the <b>number of individual battery cells</b> in your
  supply. Note that some batteries incorporate several cells &mdash; e.g. a9V PP3
  has 6 cells internally. If you're not using batteries select &quot;1&quot;. We shipped
  out sets of 8 NiMH batteries, you would select 8 here.</li>
<li><em>Battery chemistry</em>. The <b>type of battery</b> you're connecting. For example 
  &quot;Alkaline&quot; or &quot;NiMH&quot; (or &quot;N/A&quot; for non-battery supplies).</li>
</ul>

<p>After entering this data the tool will give details of the values it has
calculated and offer to write these to the MoPi board. There is detail of
<a class="cow-url" href="#config-ui">these values and how the tool works</a> below.</p>

<p><hr>
<a name="faq-gpio-pins"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Which GPIO pins does MoPi use?</b></p>

<p>As of version 4 (the Kickstarter version) MoPi uses these pins:</p>

<ul>
<li>pin 2 (and/or pin 4): 5V out</li>
<li>pins 3 and 5: i2c bus</li>
<li>pin 6 (or any other grounded pin): 0v</li>
</ul>

<p>(For a good Pi pinout diagram see <a class="cow-url" href="http://wiringpi.com/pins/">the WiringPi
site</a>.)</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-no-mopi-warning"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; I get a warning during software installation</b></p>

<p>If you're installing the software without MoPi attached to the Pi, or without
power attached to MoPi, you will get this warning message:</p>

<p><tt>/usr/sbin/simbamon: /usr/sbin/mopicli not working; MoPi not attached or
powered? (mopicli. I2C bus input/output error on read word. Check bus? Check
connection?)</tt></p>

<p>In this case you can safely ignore it.</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-stackable"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Should I get a stackable header or a low-profile one?</b> <br>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; What if the power switch isn't accessible?</b></p>

<p>If you want to fit your MoPi into tight spaces, you probably want a small
(low-profile) header. If you want to stack MoPi with other Pi add-on boards,
then you want a big, &quot;stackable&quot;, header.</p>

<p>Note that if you do get the stackable version, when you put another board on
top of MoPi it may hide the power switch and/or the LEDs. In the case of the
power switch there are solder pads on the PCB, right next to the button, to
allow fitting of a remote power switch.</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-stackable2"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; How do I connect another board?</b></p>

<p>If you want to use MoPi in combination with another Pi add-on board (e.g.
AirPi) you need a) to have ordered the version with stackable header pins, and
b) to remove the plastic collar that the board is shipped with the prevent
bending. Then the other board will just slip down onto the MoPi headers just
like those on the Pi.</p>

<p>If you've got a low profile MoPi (without the stacking pins) don't despair &mdash;
if you other board has stacking pins then MoPi can go on the top (which is
better, in fact, as you'll be able to access the power switch too!).</p>

<p>MoPi <em>should</em> be compatible with all other Pi add-on boards, as we only use
the I2C bus, which supports the connection of multiple devices.</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-voltage-low"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; I connected a power source but MoPi won't start...?</b></p>

<p>MoPi needs a minimum of 6.2 volts to run. Then it also has a (configurable)
&quot;safe depth of discharge&quot; setting to prevent damage to rechargeable batteries.
If the sources connected aren't higher than the highest of these, MoPi will
refuse to power the Pi. (If there is enough voltage to run the
microcontroller, it will blink the relevant amber LED a few times to signal
the problem.)</p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the <a class="cow-url" href="#default-profiles">Jumper</a> that selects the default
  battery profile is set for profile #1 (non-rechargeable) as this lets the
  MoPi power on under the most conditions. Be aware though that you may
  damage your rechargeable batteries if you don't configure the MoPi for them
  in software on boot, so make sure you've appropriatly...</li>
<li><a class="cow-url" href="#config-ui">Configure the MoPi</a> to accept the supply (if it will reliably
  exceed 6.2 volts under load).</li>
<li>If it still doesn't start, the batteries may be discharged! Connect some
  freshly charged ones or a higher voltage supply.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the reported voltage for a particular source seems to be high enough
to drive the Pi, but MoPi considers it too low &mdash; why? When a new source is
connected it is shunted through a simulated load for a few tenths of a second.
Batteries drop their voltage under load, and the lower their level of charge,
the larger the drop. MoPi measures the voltage under load, and if it is too
low it will refuse to use that supply. After disconnecting a power supply,
wait a few seconds before connecting a new one so that the MoPi registers the
disconnection and will re-test the newly connected battery pack.</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-regulator"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; What type of regulator chip is it? What is the voltage range?</b></p>

<p>MoPi uses a switched-mode regulator (a TPS5430 or TPS5430), so almost no power
is wasted.</p>

<p>The input voltage range is 6.2V to 20V. There's no step-up circuitry so the
battery or solar panel rig or etc. has to supply 6.2V at minimum. Consider
connecting multiple batteries or panels in series to increase voltage.</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-fuse"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it safe to bypass the Pi's built-in fuse?</b></p>

<p>Yes &mdash; in this case...</p>

<p>The issue: MoPi supplies power to the Pi over the GPIO pins, instead of via
the micro USB connector (which it leaves free so that mains power can be
plugged in at the same time as batteries if required). The 5V feed from GPIO
involves bypassing the Pi's built-in fuse (which is in line with the USB
connector).</p>

<p>Is this safe?</p>

<p>Given a correctly functioning Pi and peripherals, then the answer is a clear
&quot;yes&quot;. But what about if the Pi is faulty, or if a pin is shorted out, or if
someone connects a 3 bar electric heater to it? :-)</p>

<p>Three considerations:</p>

<p>First, MoPi is currently capable of supplying up to 2A, after which there is
an internal current limiting circuit. It uses standard voltage and power
regulation circuitry which is robust and mature, and will not allow over-volt
or over-current on the output.</p>

<p>Second, we're supplying from batteries, not mains &mdash; so as long as we don't
over-consume from the battery (which in principle we can't short of a major
internal fault) there's a limit to the amount of power we can supply to a
faulty Pi.</p>

<p>Third, not having an internal fuse is pretty standard behaviour &mdash; poke around
in the electronics of all those power supplies sitting around in your desk
drawer and you won't generally find fuses.</p>

<p>Having said that, we added an autorecovery fuse to version 3 just to be
ticking all the boxes. ;-)</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-voltage-pi"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Can I access the voltage data on MoPi from the Pi?</b></p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>The software on the Pi that talks to MoPi, simbamond, is open source and
available here:
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/simbamon">https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/simbamon</a> (See also
<a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/download.html">http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/download.html</a>.) The Raspbian maintainers have
added simbamond to their repository, so you can install it in the same way as
any other Pi sofware.</p>

<p>Simbamond listens to MoPi and logs the data in a standard manner, which other
applications can then consume as required. There's also a Python API and a
command-line interface (CLI):</p>

<pre>
sudo mopicli -v -v1 -v2
</pre>

<p>For more details, see <a class="cow-url" href="#software">the software</a> below.</p>


<p><hr>
<a name="faq-mains-solar"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Can I combine mains and solar power?</b></p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>This should work so long as you connect the mains-derived power to one of
MoPi's inputs (it will have to be a supply &gt;= 6.2 volts). MoPi will then use
mains whenever the solar output dips below the mains supply. The ideal would
be a solar panel rig that outputs e.g. 15v coupled with a 12v mains supply, or
some similar config.</p>

<p>Note also that the Pi will draw significant current, depending on the model
and the peripherals, and you will needs sufficient panels (and sunshine!) to
generate the requisite power. As a very rough guide, we've had some success
with two 10W panels running a model B (without peripherals).</p>

<p>(We're running a rig now in the workshop that has two 18V panels in parallel;
watch <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/">http://pi.gate.ac.uk/</a> and we'll post the results!) </p>

<!--% TODO-->



<p><hr>
<a name="faq-deep-discharge"></a>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; How do we avoid deep discharge of rechargeables?</b></p>

<p>The short answer it to shutdown before it happens. Rechargeable batteries
don't like being completely discharged. We always need to stop drawing from
the battery at some distance above some minimum voltage level. This level
varies for different battery chemistries (NiMH, LiPo, lead/acid, etc.) and
for different numbers of cells (eight AAs vs. two PP3s vs. one car battery,
etc.).</p>

<p>MoPi listens continuously to the voltage level on the battery inputs. How does
it know when that level is getting low? Let's identify two separate low-level
points: first, the absolute low voltage level is the point where our
micro-controller can no longer reliably run the switching regulator to produce
a constant 5V (around 6.2 volts). The second low voltage (critical) point is
just above the deep discharge level, which depends on the batteries attached.
When you use the <a class="cow-url" href="#configuration-tool">configuration tool</a> this critical
voltage point sent to the MoPi. As long as you've correctly configured your
batteries, we should be avoiding deep discharge.</p>

<p>When the MoPi decides the input voltage is critical (for either or both of its
two supplies), simbamond warns the user and shuts down the Pi cleanly (from
software first, using &quot;sudo halt&quot;, and then by cutting power).
How do we decide when to do this, that is to say, how do we pick the critical
voltage level? We've done some research on batteries. For eight NiMH 1.2 volt
cells the critical voltage is around 8 volts. For non-rechargeables, or solar
panels or a water turbine, it is the same as the absolute low level (6.2V) as
these can't suffer deep discharge.</p>

<p>Be aware though that be default the MoPi assumes that standard non-rechargable
battires (e.g. Alkalines) or an AC adapter have been connected, which sets the
critical voltage level to 6.2V. This is to get you off the ground, as the MoPi
will power on with almost anything attached like this. However, on boot the
MoPi <b>must be configured correctly for your batteries</b> or you risk damaging
your batteries through deep discharge, which is what we're trying to avoid.
This default is selectable though through our two <a class="cow-url" href="#default-profiles">default profiles</a>. If you recieved batteries from us (the &quot;battery heaven&quot;,
UPS and outdoor kit rewards) your MoPi will instead by default be configured
for 8 NiMH AA cells.</p>

<p>The critical voltage level is kind of short notice though for replacing
batteries. The configuration tool also specifies a low voltage level, which is
when the LED on the MoPi turns red and you start recieving low battery
notifications. This is set to be 1.1<span class="cow-escape">*</span>critical, so for 8 AA NiMH batteries
it's 8.8 volts. (There are other voltage levels defined too. Read more
<a class="cow-url" href="#config-ui">later</a>.)</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.4.2."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.4.2. </span>Pi Models: A, B, B+, Compute Module</h3>

<p>MoPi will work fine with the Raspberry Pi models A, B, and the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-raspberry-pi-model-b-plus/">Model B
Plus Pi</a> released summer 2014. (We don't currently support the Compute Module
directly, but we're working on it!)</p>

<p>The Model B+ is an evolution on the original Model B; it looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/model-b-plus-500x337.jpg" alt="Model B+ Pi" width="500" height="337"></p>

<p>From a mobile power point of view the B+ will perform a bit better than the B
&mdash; they're replaced the rather wasteful LDO regulator of the original with a
switched-mode supply, and with the revamp and extension of the USB subsystem
they've also improved power handling there.</p>

<p>And the good news is that there's no issue with the new CPU position on the
B+. MoPi's connection terminals actually sit on C1 (a large capacitor near the
CPU), and not on the CPU itself. You can see this here:</p>

<!--% YOUTUBE BPLUS CLIP HERE-->
<p align="center"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dEx0jNc7CaE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>


<p>So we're good to go &mdash; initial indications are that the B+ is an even better
platform for mobile power (and MoPi) than the Model B...</p>

<p><b>PS</b> If you fire up a B+ with an operating system you've been using on one of
the older models, you may discover that e.g. your USB keyboard doesn't work:
you need the most recent operating systems to run the B+. One easy way to get
one is to download a <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">new copy of
NOOBS</a> and unzip it onto a micro-SD card.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>Background: Mobile Pi Power</h1>

<p>The Pi has many advantages as a mobile platform: if the rain gets in, or a dog
eats it, a replacement doesn't break the bank, and, for a general-purpose
device, power requirements are very low.</p>

<p>Early in 2013 we realised that we needed better power management for our
mobile projects on <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/">Pi.GATE.ac.uk</a>. Five volt USB
battery packs are common, but none of them can communicate their level of
charge to the Pi. That means lots of unanticipated power cuts &mdash; a good way to
corrupt your SD card... :-(</p>

<p>And then we realised that standard rechargeables are more planet friendly. And
then that it would be cool to be able to hot-swap supplies, and that if we
could do that could we make it work as a UPS too, and how about adding a power
switch, and...</p>

<p>Fast forward: we ran a successful
<a class="cow-url" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hamishcunningham/mopi-mobile-and-24-7-power-for-the-raspberry-pi/">Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a> and now we're delivering the 4th generation
of our mobile power board. Read on!</p>

<p>Below we'll run through the characteristics of mobile power for the Pi, and
follow through with the design of <b><em>MoPi</em></b>, an add-on battery pack circuit
with Raspbian-friendly software that does lots of useful stuff for the Mobile
Pi.</p>

<p>There are three dimensions to the problem of mobile power for the Pi:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Regulation</em>, to supply the constant 5 volts<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote8"><sup><a href="#footnote8">8</a></sup></span> at up
  to around 1 amp that the (Model B) Pi requires.</li>
<li><em>Control</em>:  keeping a check on battery charge, switching the regulator off
  when charge is getting low, and reporting the current level to a monitor.</li>
<li><em>Monitoring</em>: reading level indications from <a class="cow-url" href="/pages/basics.html#gpio-pins">a GPIO
  connection</a>, reporting it to the Pi user and shutting the operating system
  down cleanly when levels get critically low.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two of these need some special hardware; the third is written as a
software <em>daemon</em>.</p>

<p>Underneath the board:</p>

<p>The stackable headers (for when MoPi is used in tandem with other add-on
boards) take up quite a lot of vertical space in order to provide a set of
pass-through pins above the MoPi board. Therefore we offered two versions,
one with the stackable header and one with a standard low-profile header.</p>

<p>This is the stackable header that we're using (from Adafruit):</p>

Header"></a></p>

<p>You can see an example here of the low-profile header, on the revision 2
board:</p>

<p>Here's the other side of the second-generation prototype board with some
batteries:</p>

<p>The shape of the PCB allows it to fit into the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-raspberry-pi-case">Pibow</a> without blocking the Pi's
display output (soon to be used for the

<a class="cow-url" href="http://raspi.tv/2014/raspberry-pi-official-7-inch-dsi-prototype-preview">DSI touch screen</a>). There's space for a pass-through GPIO header so that other
add-on boards can share space on the Pi, separate LEDs for overall function
and for the two power inputs, and a neat little power switch on the top.</p>

<p>(The good people at <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> are doing a custom

<li>2-way communication (on the I2C bus) between MoPi and Pi supports
  configuration from the Pi.</li>
<li>Screw terminals, stackable headers, remoting pads and self-resetting fuse.</li>
<li>Remote power-off and timer-based wake-up added.</li>

<p><a name="perfect"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3.2. </span>The Perfect Battery Pack</h2>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/images/mopi/perfect-pack.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/perfect-pack.png" alt="The perfect pack" width="563" height="295"></a></p>

<p>What would the perfect Pi battery pack look like? It should be:</p>

<p><b>Low cost</b>. Dedicated battery supplies like those sold as phone charging
devices are great, but when they no longer hold charge the whole unit has to
be recycled. Standard commodity batteries and the reusable chargers that serve
them are well-established and already present in many households. They're the
cheapest and most flexible option.</p>

<p><b>Flexible</b>. Got a solar panel handy? I want to plug it into the circuitry and
have it drive the Pi as long as the sun shines, then let a battery take over
when the clouds come. Stuck for power but got an old laptop supply or 12 volt
car charger handy? Strip the cables, connect, and power my Pi please! Plugging
a bunch of peripherals? I want to be able to drive them all via my battery
pack. And etc.</p>

<p><b>Polite</b>. When you're running your laptop on battery and it runs out of juice
it gives you a nice polite warning message or two, and, when the level gets
really low, it automagically shuts down the machine. This is important to
allow the operating system (e.g. <a class="cow-url" href="/pages/basics.html#footnote1">Raspbian Linux</a> on
the Pi) to close up any open files and generally tidy the house before power
disappears. Just killing the power without warning is risky &mdash; sometimes
nothing bad happens, but in the worst case you can end up with a machine that
won't boot and needs a complete reinstall. So I want my battery pack to signal
the Pi when levels are low, so that the Pi can shut itself down cleanly. Good
manners are important, after all. :-)</p>

<p>While we're at it, if the battery pack is going to tell the Pi when it is
getting low and needs to shut down, why not have an <b>on/off switch</b> into the
bargain? The &quot;off&quot; signal triggers clean shutdown, and is very convenient when
you're using the Pi in any kind of kiosk or appliance context. Several
projects have implemented this type of on/off facility in its own right &mdash;
e.g. <a class="cow-url" href="http://lowpowerlab.com/atxraspi/">the ATX Pi supply</a> or the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.susa.net/wordpress/2012/11/raspberry-pi-power-controller/">PIC
controller</a> &mdash; it's definitely a useful function to have on board.</p>

<p><b>Uninterruptible</b>. I don't want to stop work when my battery is low if I've
got a charged pack handy (or a different source of power, like a car cigarette
lighter socket or the like). So I'd like my battery pack to support <b>hot-swap</b>
of a new electricity supply, either a new set of batteries or some other new
input.</p>

<p><b>Eco-friendly</b>. One of the great things about the Pi is its low carbon
footprint. The recent ones in <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/">my lab</a> are made in
Wales, so they haven't travelled half way around the world to reach me. The
base system is bare-bones, which encourages reuse of power supplies, monitors,
cables and the like. The power consumption is low &mdash; particularly for the
Model A, which gets by on 300 mA or below (at 5 volts this adds up to around
1.5 watts &mdash; contrast that with
<a class="cow-url" href="https://secure.www.upenn.edu/computing/resources/category/hardware/article/computer-power-usage">50 watts and above</a> for a desktop PC!). There's no spare planet and our
resources are definetely finite, so we definitely want to support rechargeable
batteries. Preferably not the built-in variety (like a mobile phone) that are
hard to recycle.</p>

<p><b>Communicative</b>. I want to know when the battery is full, when it is starting
to get low and when it is critical. I want to be able to get those signals
both when logged in to the Pi and visually from the battery pack itself.
(Look! Flashing lights!)</p>

<p><b>Robust</b>. I'm pretty unreliable at the best of times. When crawling through
the underbrush with a camera-equiped Pi rig
<a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/posts/2013/08/05/chasing-pine-martens/">in search of Pine Marten lairs</a> I'm
very likely to plug the wrong end of the stick and end up with my foot in my
mouth, to coin a mixed metaphor or three. Over-volt and spike protection are
definitely requirements.</p>

<p><a name="software"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>The MoPi Software Suite</h1>

<p>This section describes how the MoPi software suite works and how the
architecture of MoPi hangs together.</p>

<p>There are four main parts of the puzzle:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>daemon</em> which runs in the background on the Pi, which is called
  <a class="cow-url" href="#simbamond">simbamond</a> (simbamon daemon, or SImple BAttery MONnitor
  daemon). It is available as a package for Raspbian, and installing it pulls
  in all MoPi software.</li>
<li>An interface that communicates with the MoPi hardware over the I2C protocol.
  This interface is wrapped up as a <a class="cow-url" href="#api">Python API</a>.</li>
<li>A <a class="cow-url" href="#cli">command-line tool</a> that uses the Python API and provides a
  language-neutral portable method for talking to the board from the Pi.</li>
<li>A <a class="cow-url" href="#configuration-tool">configuration user interface</a> that simplifies the
  process of setting up MoPi to deal with different types and numbers of
  batteries, and other types of power supply.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the code for these components is
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/simbamon">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of this section discusses each of the main elements in turn,
describes how to check up on the beast as it runs, and finishes up with more
detail of the implementation of the daemon.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="simbamond"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.1. </span>simbamond, the simbamon daemon</h2>

<p>When the Pi (or any other Linux system) boots, several system services are
started that will run continuously until the machine is shut down again. These
services are called <em>daemons</em>, of which simbamon is one. The first point of
entry, used by the operating system to start, stop, etc., is an init (think
initialisation) script:
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/blob/master/simbamon/simbamond.default"><tt>/etc/init.d/simbamond</tt></a>. This script (which you can think of as a wrapper for
management) calls another script to do the real work:
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/blob/master/simbamon/simbamon"><tt>/usr/sbin/simbamon</tt></a>.</p>

<p>One of key features of MoPi is that it supports many different types of
batteries and many other types of power supply (from solar panels to elastic
bands!). Coping with the requirements of all these monsters needs a huge wodge
of configuration data, which (following Debian Linux convention) lives in
<tt>/etc/default/</tt> in a file (again, confusingly) called
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/blob/master/simbamon/simbamond.init"><tt>simbamond</tt></a>.<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote9"><sup><a href="#footnote9">9</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Together these three script files make up a new system service that polls the
MoPi hardware every couple of seconds and shouts loudly when an electron
shortage appears on the horizon. If no one is listening and the shortage gets
acute, the daemon tells the Pi to take a rest and issues the <tt>shutdown</tt>
command.</p>

<p>There is <a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/pages/mopi.html#simbamon">more detail below</a>.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="api"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.2. </span>The Python API</h2>

<p>How do we talk to the hardware? From MoPi version 3 onwards we shifted away
from using the Pi's general-purpose GPIO pins (using a tool called WiringPi).
This worked well, but it used a pin for each bit of data that we wanted to
ship between the board and the Pi. As time went on we found more and more data
that we needed to share (and we also came across other add-on boards that use
lots of GPIO pins &mdash; e.g. <a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/posts/2014/02/07/airpi1/">AirPi</a>).</p>

<p>Luckily the Pi also hosts several other inter-board communication options,
including the I2C protocol, which uses only two pins, can talk to multiple
devices over the same two wires, and allows transfer of much larger amounts of
data.</p>

<p>There are two ways to talk over I2C from the Pi: a set of command-line tools
written in C, and a Python module. Both work, but the Python version seems to
have had more attention from Pi users and developers, and even has support for
multi-byte reads. So we've implemented an API for MoPi in Python<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote10"><sup><a href="#footnote10">10</a></sup></span>, which
now lives in a file called
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/blob/master/simbamon/mopiapi.py"><tt>mopiapi.py</tt></a>. For Python programmers this code provides a natural and
efficient method of including MoPi facilities in their programs. For example,
writing a system tray applet...</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="cli"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.3."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.3. </span>MoPi from the Command Line</h2>

<p>The observant amongst you may have noticed that simbamon is not written in
Python<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote11"><sup><a href="#footnote11">11</a></sup></span> &mdash; how does the daemon talk to the board when the API is in Python?
That's where
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/blob/master/simbamon/mopicli"><tt>mopcli</tt></a> comes in, which is a command-line interface to the Python API. This
script provides convenient methods for the daemon to use, or for Pi users to
query and configure the board, or for our configuration utility &mdash; which by
amazing coincidence is described next.</p>

<p>To see what the beast can do, ask it for help by typing <tt>sudo mopicli -h</tt>;
you'll get something like this:</p>

<p><a name="config-ui"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.4."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.4. </span>Configuring Your Power Supplies</h2>

<p>Not quite so easy is choosing the correct voltage settings for different
battery chemistries and different combinations of cells (not to mention other
types of power supply). In each case MoPi needs to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the approximate voltage that the battery will supply when fully
  charged?</li>
<li>What is the point at which we're getting low on charge? (And therefore may
  expect to run out of juice within a few minutes or so.)</li>
<li>what is the minimum safe discharge voltage? (Just above the critical deep
  discharge level of the batteries.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The mid-point between the first two voltages is is the conventional definition
of what a good level of charge is, so that's where we swap between lighting up
our RGB led in blue and lighting it in green. When we reach the low charge
point we turn the LED red, and when we reach the minimum safe discharge
voltage (or the minimum safe operating voltage of our micro-controller at 6.2V
if that is higher) then we initiate shutdown.</p>

<p>Let's look at each of these values in more detail:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Fully-charged voltage</em>. This is equal to the fully-charged voltage of each
  cell in the battery pack multiplied by the number of cells. Like most things
  with batteries, it varies according to battery chemistry &mdash; e.g. an Alkaline
  cell generates 1.5V; a NiMH 1.2V; a LiIon 3.7V.</li>
<li><em>The low charge level</em>. When you record the voltage delivered by a battery
  over time, most of the curves exhibit a knee shape. Before the knee voltage
  drop is reasonably slow; after the knee if drops much more sharply. We need
  to try and warn the user around the knee point, so that they have enough
  time to replace the battery before it drains completely, but not so much
  time that there is still lots of usable charge left.</li>
<li><em>Minimum safe discharge voltage</em>. This applies to all rechargeable
  batteries. If we discharge below this level, then the capacity to recharge
  will be impared. This makes it a very important factor in battery life for
  the long term, and one which we've done a lot of work to model and adapt to.
  (Ever wondered why the rechargeables that you put in your alarm clock or
  torch lasted such a short time? Most devices have no way of knowing about
  the minimum discharge level for the particular chemistry you're using!)</li>
<li><em>Minimum safe operating level</em>. MoPi uses a sophisticated microcontroller to
  analyse battery behaviour, control its LEDs and deliver data to the software
  suite running on the Pi. If the supply voltage to MoPi falls below a certain
  level (around 6.2V) then the microcontroller may terminate, or even start to
  behave unpredictably. It is very important to trap rapid voltage drop before
  it reaches this point.</li>
</ul>

<p>To deal with all these considerations, the current version of the software
stores these values:</p>

<pre>
        TYPE         CELL/FULL  MIN

  1     non-battery     9.0     6.2
  2     NiMH            1.2     0.95
  3     Alkaline        1.5     0.8
  4     Lead Acid       2.0     1.58
  5     Lithium Ion     3.7     3.0
  6     LiPo            4.2     3.0
  7     NiCd            1.2     1.1
</pre>

<p>When we know what chemistry we're dealing with, and how many cells, we can
then make good guesses about where the four levels above should fall. But how
do we know what the chemistry is? Two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have <a class="cow-url" href="#default-profiles">two built-in defaults</a>, one for 8 NiMH cells
  (which is the battery pack that we're supplying to backers who requested
  one), and one for 8   Alkaline non-rechargeables. The latter is what MoPi
  will assume when running out of the box; the former is activated by
  removing the on-board jumper provided for the purpose<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote12"><sup><a href="#footnote12">12</a></sup></span>.</li>
<li>You tell us! To this end we have developed a configuration UI on the Pi,
  which is the last piece in our four part software puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration UI uses the same tools as the Raspberry Pi's utility
(<tt>raspi-config</tt>), so it should be simple and familiar, and it can be used over
all types of connections (including remote login with <tt>ssh</tt>). Here's a
screenshot or three:</p>

<p>As you can imagine, figuring out how all this stuff is working and identifying
bugs and incorrect behaviour is quite a challenge. Luckily we have some great
tools to help us, one of which is <a class="cow-url" href="https://mmonit.com/">Monit</a>. This little
gem is itself a daemon, and it has facilities for one thousand and one

<p>This is great for keeping check on things during load testing (particularly
heavy loads which have a tendency to cause odd corner case bugs to trigger),
but it is also a great tool for maximising service availability &mdash; the

should it ever crash, for example.</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.6.1."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.6.1. </span>Design Notes</h3>

<p>There are a variety of ways that laptops communicate with and control their
batteries, including the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/inner_workings_of_a_smart_battery">Smart Battery specification</a> (which often uses SMBus, a variant of the I2C
interface that the Pi supports). In Linux the resultant data feed is then
modelled using a power management abstraction (of which ACPI is the most
recent) and manipulated using a driver specific to the battery in use.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea? Yes, in the abstract, but implementing a new driver
is quite a job &mdash;
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/acpi/battery.c">here's
one</a> that runs to 1200 lines of C code, for example. It is also not clear how
to do this when we have the ability to plug in batteries of different types,
which is something we really wanted to support.</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>If in doubt, take the simple option. All Linux systems share the system
service or <em>daemon</em> concept. A system-level process which gets run during 
startup. It is quite easy to implement a battery monitor daemon that
listens on the Pi's I2C bus for level changes signalled by the MoPi
microcontroller board. The daemon then makes entries in the standard system
logs as a simple way to share data with other subsystems, and can be
configured to send a warning message to all users if levels are low. Best of
all, the daemon can easily shut down the Pi cleanly before the regulator
voltage gets too low for reliable operation.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4.6.2."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4.6.2. </span>Implementation</h3>

<p>This section gives more detail of the implementation of the simbamon battery
monitoring daemon. It is designed for the MoPi boards, but should be quite
easily reusable for other battery power projects. simbamon is an open source
Linux daemon for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitoring battery levels (for us this is done via the   <a class="cow-url" href="#cku"><tt>mopicli</tt></a>
  command).</li>
<li>Sending warning messages to the user if the battery is low.</li>
<li>Shutting down cleanly at critical battery levels.</li>
<li>Managing a power supply on/off switch.</li>
<li>Writing relevant data to the system logs.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/simbamon">the source code</a> on GitHub. The core of the daemon is defined in three files:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>/etc/init.d/simbamond</tt> &mdash; an interface to the <tt>init</tt> subsystem that Linux
  uses to manage daemons (amongst other things)</li>
<li><tt>/usr/sbin/simbamon</tt> &mdash; the daemon itself</li>
<li><tt>/etc/default/simbamond</tt> &mdash; configuration data</li>
</ul>

<p>The first of these, <tt>simbamond</tt>, is used by the operating system to start and
stop simbamon at boot or shutdown time, and can be used to control simbamon
manually when required. For example this command will stop the daemon:</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
sudo service simbamond stop
</pre>The configuration file, (also) <tt>simbamond</tt>, defines how simbamon will take
action. Of primary interest is the last few lines, which specifies the battery
configuration in <a class="cow-url" href="#cli">CLI</a> format. There's some generic stuff at the top
too about monitoring frequency and stuff, it's pretty well explained in the
file.</p>

</pre>The MoPi microcontroller supplies these states via the Raspberry Pi's
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I2C bus</a> (and also sets on-board
indicator LEDs accordingly). The core of simbamon, a shell script that lives

<p>The MoPi circuitry consists of two parts: a single-chip microcontroller and a
five volt switching mode regulator. The microcontroller (with embedded
firmware) implements all the functions related to voltage level monitoring,
level signalling (via the LEDs and the GPIO interface), and on/off switching
of the +5V supply to the Pi. Battery voltage levels are measured using the
built-in microcontroller ADC<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote14"><sup><a href="#footnote14">14</a></sup></span>.</p>

<p>The schematic looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/schematic.png" alt="An early MoPi schematic" width="500" height="292"></p>

<p>Two yellow (or amber) LEDs are positioned next to the twin power pack inputs
(screw terminals), and indicate their status (blinking when either voltage is
critically low). The overall voltage level of both power inputs is indicated
by one RGB (three colour) LED and is also sent to the Raspberry Pi over the
I2C bus. The 5 volts to the Pi is generated by a highly efficient switch mode
voltage stabiliser, driven by the microcontroller. An open source daemon
running on the Pi listens to the I2C signal, informs the user of low battery
levels and shuts the Pi down cleanly when levels are critically low (or when
the power switch is pressed, or a delayed shutdown counter expires).</p>

<p>To start the 5V generator the power button should be pressed and held for 3
seconds. The microcontroller checks the voltage level of the attached battery
packs under load and if it is above the defined critical battery threshold, it
switches the stabiliser on to generate 5V for the Pi. The yellow LED for the
connected power input lights up, and the RGB LED lights up blue when the
battery pack is fully charged (or green if the voltage level is within the
acceptable operating range). The current voltage level is also accessible to
the simbamon daemon on the Pi via I2C<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote15"><sup><a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup></span>. During operation, the
microcontroller continuously monitors the voltage level, and when it falls
beneath a low battery level that it believes leaves only a few minutes of
operational time, it switches the RGB LED to red. Simultaneously the yellow
LED for the low battery starts flashing, indicating that the pack needs
replacement.</p>

<!--% YOUTUBE MOPI BOARD CLIP HERE-->
<p align="center"> <iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/33ZzeEIOMLg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>


<p>At the same time the LED turns red and the yellow LED starts flashing,
simbamon (the monitoring daemon on the Pi) gets a low battery flag and informs
the user that they should either plug in another supply or shut down (again by
pressing the power button for 3 seconds). If nothing changes and the battery
continues to discharge down to a critical level, then the RGB LED starts
flashing red and MoPi forces a shutdown. The user can then remove the old
battery pack for charging.<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote16"><sup><a href="#footnote16">16</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Behaviour has to be adjusted for multiple battery chemistries; this is done
within the microcontroller firmware and can be <a class="cow-url" href="#configuration-tool">configured from the Pi</a>. MoPi has two <a class="cow-url" href="#default-profiles">default discharging
profiles</a> pre-programmed &mdash; one for NiMH rechargeable batteries and one for
ordinary Alkaline batteries. Out of the box the Alkaline profile is active; to
choose the NiMH profile, remove the small jumper located on the under side of
the board. The jumper applies to both power inputs. The state of the jumper
can be overridden via configuration from the Pi, separately for each one of
the power inputs. <b>Note</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The jumper is tiny, and easy to lose. If you need to remove it, do so, but
  it is then best to replace it, but on only one of the pins.</li>
<li>When supplying MoPi <em>with NiMH rechargeables</em> we remove the jumper to
  activate the relevant default profile. (And replace it on only one pin.)</li>
</ul>

<p>MoPi can be used as a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) in two ways. If the
Pi is powered over its 5V micro-USB socket and that power drops while MoPi is
active, the supply fails over transparently, allowing the Pi to continue work
uninterruped. Note though that if the battery supply drops to critical level
simbamon will shut the Pi down. We're working on various circuits that work
around this issue. Alternatively an AC adapter can be plugged into one power
input on the MoPi and batteries into the other. Neither option gets around
charging the batteries. Like we said, we're working on it.</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-6.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">6.1. </span>The Longer-Lasting Snack</h2>

<p>So, how long will the batteries last?</p>

<p>My first test was a Model B Pi with almost no load (USB keyboard and mouse;
monitor attached over HDMI but switched off after starting the test; no
network or other peripherals). Using eight rechargeable Duracell AA NiMH 2400
mAh batteries (like
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Duracell-Rechargeable-Accu-2400-Batteries/dp/B0031OE6LG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375768484&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=duracell+nimh">these ones</a>) the Pi ran for 9 hours 31 minutes. Not bad! Especially when you
consider that the MoPi regulator supports hot-swap of new charged packs &mdash;
this looks very viable for mobile Pi applications of all shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>For comparison I set up the same rig with a USB battery pack from RS
(<a class="cow-url" href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/power-banks/7757508/">this one</a>, a 5200 mAh
Lithium polymer model). The results were remarkably similar, with the RS pack
lasting for 9 hours and 21 minutes.</p>

<p>Since then we've conducted <a class="cow-url" href="#detailed-testing">101 different tests</a>. There
are three key factors in battery life: <b>1.</b> Model A vs. Model B; <b>2.</b> the
peripherals; <b>3.</b> Activity. To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can expect a Model A in some cases to get more than double the battery
  life of a Model B.</li>
<li>What you connect to the Pi makes a huge difference. For example, WiFi is a
  power hog. It will more than halve the battery life of a Model A. It will be
  even worse on a Model B. A keyboard or accelerometer in contrast, is cheap.
  <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.piborg.com/xloborg">XLoBorg</a> won't reduce your running time by
  much in comparison.</li>
<li>How much you're doing impacts things. If the Pi is effectively idle, just
  running wit the odd SD card read/write you get the best battery life. As you
  use the CPU more battery life goes down.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also connect two battery packs to MoPi and get double the running
time.</p>

<p><a name="detailed-testing"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-6.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">6.2. </span>Battery life</h2>

<p>We've tried using the MoPi in a few different ways, with different
combinations of Pis, Peripherals, Batteries, and Tasks to find out how long
the batteries can last. So far we've tried the Model A with some different USB
devices and with different batteries. We've also tried the Model B with
different batteries. Let's have a look at some of the results...</p>

<p>A Model A with two sets of 8 fresh RS NiMH 2600 mAH batteries (16 total):
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopia2.16fresh.png"></p>

<p>First a quick explanation of the plot. The top half of the figure shows the
voltage levels. The aqua line is the voltage level of the active power source.
The batteries pretty much drain perfectly in parallel so it's effectively
really the voltage level of each battery pack in this case. (If there's only
one pack attached it's the voltage level of that pack.) The dashed blue,
green, red, and crimson lines are the voltage levels that affect LED color.
Above the green line the LED is blue. Below the green line it's green, until
the red line where it's red. Below the crimson line the LED is flashing red
and the MoPi is about to shutdown.</p>

<p>The bottom half of the figure shows what we're most interested... <em>time</em>.
Specifically the colored bar shows how long the MoPi was showing each color on
the RGB status LED. The yellow bit of the bar corresponds to how long the
input status LED was flashing. So in this case we had 5 hours 30 minutes of
blue LED. 43 hours 8 minutes of green LED. 2 hours 44 minutes of red LED. A
whopping total of 50 hours 38 minutes. Of a Pi. Turned on. Running on AA
batteries.</p>

<p>This of course is pretty much the ideal scenario. The Raspberry Pi was just
sitting there, nothing attached, not doing anything but logging voltage once
every 5 seconds. The batteries were brand new. The little dips in the aqua
line probably correspond to the SD card being written to or some service (like
cron) on the Pi activating briefly before going back to being an idle process.</p>

<p>Let's look at a less ideal scenario. Two sets of the same batteries connected
to a Model A, but this time they're old. They've been through at least a dozen
or two recharge cycles. There's USB Ethernet<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote17"><sup><a href="#footnote17">17</a></sup></span> with an active SSH connection. What happens now?
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopia2.16old.usbethernet.png"></p>

<p>Oh my! Battery life is now down to half of what it was! Only 24 hours 19
minutes in this case. The Ethernet and SSH connection has definetely used some
power. How much it's hard to tell, but this is definetely a more realistic 
usage scenario.</p>

<p>The shape of the discharge curve is also interesting to see. Voltage drops
much more sharply, giving less warning that the batteries are low. This is
almost certainly a result of the age of the batteries.</p>

<p>Now how about just 8 old batteries:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopia2.8old.usbethernet.png"></p>

<p>12 hours! It's pretty much bang on half the uptime for half the batteries.</p>

<p>What about WiFi now? Same deal, Model A, 8 old batteries and an active SSH
connection:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopia1.8old.wifi.png"></p>

<p>10 hours 30 minutes. We've paid a 1:30 penalty for wireless flexibility.
That's roughly 12% drop in battery life. With two battery packs we'd loose
around 3 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>What about the Model B? Let's go back to full idle and 8 fresh batteries:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopib2.8fresh.noethernet.png"></p>

<p>10 hours 46 minutes. Wait, what? With a Model A we'd expect around 24 hours
for 8 fresh batteries. What's different then between the Model A and the
Model B? There are at least two things: 512 MB of RAM vs 256 MB of RAM; and
the Model B has the on board Ethernet (which includes a USB hub for the two
USB ports that the Model B sports). I'm inclined to blame the USB chip here.
According to the <a class="cow-url" href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/9512.pdf">datasheet</a> it has a pretty high current draw at 3.3V, which needs to go
through the very ineffecient linear regulator on the Model B, further sucking
power.</p>

<p>On a side note we can confirm these batteries are fresh by the shape of the
dishcarge curve. That sharp drop off is missing.</p>

<p>Let's connect the Ethernet on the Model B, but still leave off an active
connection:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopib2.8fresh.ethernet.png"></p>

<p>Ouch. We've lost another hour and a half. Simply by connecting the Ethernet,
which further activates the USB chip and lights up those LEDs and has the
system ready to respond to incoming packets.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens with activity and old batteries now:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopib1.8old.ethernet.png"></p>

<p>Down to 7 hours 39 minutes. That's another hour and a half or so. Based on
the information about power consumption available, that still looks like it's
mostly due to the Ethernet rather than the age of the batteries. Clearly the
way to go is to use a Model A. Anything to get away from the USB chip.</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-6.2.1."></a><h3 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">6.2.1. </span>Battery life under load</h3>

<p>So far the testing presented has been essentially an idle system (just
logging) or a system under light load (active ssh). The next set of testing
cranked up CPU usage to look in more detail at how that impacted battery life.
The first question is how to achieve CPU load?</p>

<p>Overclockers, people who crank up their CPU speed, often ask the same
question. In their case though, they're not looking to look into battery life,
but instead they want to check that their system remains stable and won't
crash even at higher speeds. They call this &quot;stress testing&quot;, which is really
just essentially creating CPU load. A popular method of stress testing a CPU
is to use
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime95#Use_for_stress_testing">Prime95</a>.</p>

<p>Prime95 is a program that verifies known prime numbers are indeed prime as
calculated. Often when a CPU is under extreme conditions, the calculations
start to come out incorrect, and this tells an overclocker to reduce CPU speed
to increase stability. This bit isn't so interesting as we're not really
overclocking the Pi (although it is <a class="cow-url" href="http://elinux.org/RPiconfig#Overclocking">possible</a>). The idea though of calculating prime numbers to generate CPU load
is what we're after.</p>

<p>A few years ago I played around with testing prime numbers in C++. I rewrote
that program to be something suitable for applying CPU load to the Pi and put
it on <a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/hamishcunningham/pi-tronics/tree/master/loadtest">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>So! Our first test setup now looks like this. A Model A with 16 AAs and CPU
load applied in the form of our prime number testing program:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopia2.16fresh.cpuload.png"></p>

<p>An uptime of around 41 hours. That's a drop of around 9 hours. However, there
are actually two things happening in this test. There's CPU load yes, but also
the batteries were charged a few days before actually being used. As a result
the start voltage is a little bit lower: 10.4 V as opposed to 10.8 V. Shelf
discharge will account for some loss of uptime. Here it's probably around 45
minutes, but this only gets worse with older batteries.</p>

<p>I'll perform this test again later with more freshly charged batteries, but
there's an important lesson here. We've said it before and we'll say it again.
Battery life is <b>variable</b>. It's not just how you're using your Pi, or what's
connected, but also the batteries themselves can affect how long it runs for.
The more absolutely consistent you can get your setup the more predictable
battery life will be, but it's a good idea to have a plan for when the
batteries run low. That's why the MoPi can tell the Pi to shutdown.</p>

<p>But what about the Model B? Yes, we tested that too. 8 AAs, Ethernet, and
active SSH displaying our prime number results:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/mopib2.8fresh.ethernet.cpuload.png"></p>

<p>Just under 8 hours with CPU load and Ethernet... compared to 9 hours without
CPU load? More time (1.5 hours) is lost simply by connecting the Ethernet than
by using the CPU. This says two things. The first, which I've already said, is
that the Ethernet is extremely power hungry on the Model B. The second is that
really, the CPU of the Pi is pretty energy efficient.</p>

<p>Food for thought. In 8 hours, the Model B managed to check if numbers were
prime from 1 up to 690k. My Core i5 desktop did the same check in <em>6 and a
half minutes</em>...</p>

<p>Solar power! We've tried two setups. A low power setup using old panels, and a
setup using brand new quite beefy panels. Needless to say we've had more luck
with the latter, but the former is interesting too...</p>

<p>Way back in 2002 I tried powering my Z scale model trains with solar panels to
some small success. Since then I've held onto the eighteen 5 V/30 mA Panasonic
BP-376634 panels I got then, which I try on different projects every now and
then. I sucessfully charged a Nokia. I couldn't power a Model B when it was
new. But mostly they sit in a drawer. Now though I have a Model A, which I've
proved to myself has a much lower energy requirement so I thought I'd try them
out yet again.</p>

<p>Even though I have eighteen of the panels, my shelf space is limited, some are
damanaged, and the aligator clips I use for connecting them are also damaged.
It was practical to setup 9, which I put into three sets of three panels for
15 V and 90 mA. While this is probably less than the requirements of the Model
A, I figured they might supplement the batteries some and increase how long I
could run on a single pack. Which to be fair, they did... </p>

<p>After configuring the input on the MoPi to non-battery source using the
<tt>mopi</tt> command, a Model A with 8 older AAs and Wi-fi does this:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/solar/mopia1.8old.wifi.2.png"></p>

<p>10 and a half hours, which agrees with the time above. Now with the panels:
<img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/solar/mopia1.8old.wifi.solar.png"></p>

<p>10 hours, and <b>45 minutes</b>! A whole extra 15 minutes! To be fair as well,
these batteries probably sat a bit after charging before I used them for this
test, so it does seem to help out some, just don't count on it. I suspect
using 10 panels to up the voltage (getting 20 V) would have helped a bit as
well.</p>

<p>In any event, I know we can do better. See below the outside of our workshop:</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/solar/DSCF0078.JPG"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/solar/small/DSCF0078.JPG" alt="Beefy Panels"></a></p>

<p>The eyes of that smile are made up of
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/10w-solar-panel-kit-l14br">Maplin 10 W</a> panels,
rated at 17.5 V or 580 mA. And we have two of them. (We also live in Britain
where it's not particularly sunny. That's why we have two of them.) They're
connected in parallel to one of the inputs of a MoPi powering a Model B. (You
can also see the Pi is connected to Ethernet &mdash; this is so that it keeps the
time...)</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/solar/DSCF0088.JPG"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/solar/small/DSCF0088.JPG" alt="Panel Specs"></a></p>

<p>I've also done something clever. The Pi in this case is configured to shutdown
nicely around 8 PM. Before this though the MoPi's power-on timer is set for 14
hours, so that the Pi will turn on at 10 AM. This means the Pi is on when the
sun is up, and off when it's down. Ideally then this setup should last ages
past the 8 hours the 8 AAs it's also attached to would suggest. Let's see...</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/solar/mopisolar.1.png"></p>

<p>Nearly 19 hours! That's pretty good! We can see huge spikes in the graph where
we're in direct sunlight and the panels overpower the batteries. At this
point, with some clever circuitry, we could store that energy. Unfortuantely
that's something we've not sorted, but now we know it's probably doable.</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/graphs/solar/mopisolar.2.png"></p>

<p>A second trial shows similar results. The sharp eyed here may notice that
there's no red time, that's because it actually slept a second night and
powered on the next day for another 17 minutes until the batteries died. At 10
AM those windows aren't in direct sunlight yet to keep it going, so for
plotting reasons I left it off. Over 19 hours!</p>

<p>You can also see a slight increase in voltage from 24 to 26 hours, which I
believe are the panels coming into direct light providing more current to
offset the draw from the batteries. A Model A would have been entirely solar
powered that day. It's definitely feasible to power a Pi off solar.</p>

<p>So to summarize:</p>

<p>Bigger panels are better, but even little ones can help. Get the panels
positioned so that they're in direct sunlight for as long as possible.
Provided the panels are powerful enough, they will still help even out of
direct light, but it's exponential. It'd be good to charge the batteries when
there's extra power, because there clearly is here. We'll let you know if we
sort it.</p>

<p>Most of our testing used external power supplies to make the development

<p>The Pi is drawing 170 mA; MoPi is getting 11.9 volts from the PSU. The PSU
connects up to one of MoPi's supply inputs using a couple of re-purposed panel

<p>This multimeter has been running reliably for 30 years! Ok, at some point I
couldn't get the batteries any more, so I had to bodge up a container for a
different size, but apart from that it has been pretty much perfect. I plugged
it into our new PSU, dialed up 6.2 volts and hey presto! The meter and the PSU
agreed 100%. Can I marry my multimeter?</p>

<p>We've got a new shiney one too, but the romance just isn't there:</p>

<!--% %image(images/mopi/test-rigs/workshop-20140409-153039-500x375.jpg, Test Rig, 500)-->

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/mopi/test-rigs/workshop-20140409-153043.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/test-rigs/workshop-20140409-153043-500x375.jpg" alt="Test Rig" width="500" height="375"></a></p>

<p>In early testing we often reached states that caused error conditions of one
sort or another on the Pi. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The green indicator LED repeatedly blinks three times when the <tt>loader.bin</tt>
  bootloader file is not present &mdash; in our case this was because a hard
  power shutdown caused corruption of the SD card.</li>
<li>The red power indicator LED may blink if the battery charge is very low and
  it is failing to drive the Pi (and if the microcontroller is not properly
  shutting down the regulator).</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases like these the Embedded Linux wiki page on
<a class="cow-url" href="http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting">RPI troubleshooting</a> is your friend!
Another useful part of the Pi-oneer's toolkit is the excellent
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4100">NOOBS</a> setup from the Pi
foundation, which makes it easier to restore your SD card after failures.</p>

<p>But inevitably the life of electronics prototyping brings its fair share of
mystery &mdash; why have my GPIO monitoring pins all gone low, all of a sudden,
when the indicator LED and the microcontroller still work? Cue much head
scratching and serious faces. Followed by a session with the debug header and
the diagnostics rig on the microcontroller &mdash; and it turns out that a single
page of memory (which happenned to contain the code running the IO pins) has
been wiped, presumably by power fluctuations at the low battery state. Time to
add some more diodes!</p>

<p>And here's a typical gotcha:</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: have the bright idea of reusing the <em>battery totally empty</em> state
  for the <em>shutdown button pressed</em> state.</li>
<li>Step 2: implement the code changes in the daemon and install. Reboot.</li>
<li>Step 3: oops, my Pi just shut down as soon as it started. Hmmm.</li>
<li>Step 4: oh yeah, that's also the default state of the GPIO pins when the
  MoPi rig isn't connected. Ah. That means that my Pi is going to shutdown
  every time I start it up. And Lubo just took the prototype boards back to
  the lab. Um. Looks like the <em>Donkey of the Day</em> award is coming my way
  again.</li>
<li>Step 5: waste half an hour remembering how to mount the SD card read-write
  on another machine and manually editing the daemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>We learn from our mistakes &mdash; that's why I make as many as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, the current author has found it useful to run around in circles,
screaming and shouting. (It doesn't fix the electronics, of course, but if
you're lucky it generates sympathy in those around you, or at least a desire
on their part to give you a beer to shut you up.)</p>

<p>Want to strap a hackable GoPro-type cam to your skiing helmet? Or make a
Wii-type remote and splash virtual paint onto your devices? Or measure
atmospheric pollution in the garden with the AirPi sensor kit? The Raspberry
Pi is a great platform for these types of applications, but you'll need a
mobile power supply when you get out and about away from the wall socket.</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/images/pibrush/art/1379031321.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/pibrush/art/1379031321-500x281.png" alt="Number 1" width="500" height="281"></a></p>

<p>If you've been following The Story of Pi these last couple of years you'll
have come across 1001 power supplies &mdash; from batteries to solar panels, from
car connections to water turbines. The Pi was designed to give a boost to
science and technology education, and it has already made a huge impact &mdash;
here in the UK, for example, we have a shiney new computing curriculum in the
works. There a whole load of reasons why we need to <b>educate our kids about
technology</b>, and how technology can help them cope with the challenges that
the future holds. And not just any technology &mdash; the Pi has a low carbon
footprint and is made in the EU.</p>

<p>The MoPi Kickstarter offered three Pi outdoor experimenter kits to help teach
the links between technology, climate, wildlife and the like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Outdoor Adventurer Kit</li>
<li>Outdoor Experimenter Kit (Light)</li>
<li>Outdoor Experimenter Kit (Light and Air)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there's various projects that our backers have started (yours not here?
send us a pic!).</p>

<p>We'll detail them here to give a flavour of the applications of the thing, but
really the sky's the limit: every mobile Pi project has a place for MoPi.</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-7.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">7.1. </span>Outdoor Adventure Kit</h2>

<p>The base level kit has everything you need to get out and about: a Raspberry

<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-7.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">7.2. </span>Outdoor Experimenter Kit (Light)</h2>

<p>This kit has all of the previous one, plus the Raspberry Pi camera module (day

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-7.3."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">7.3. </span>Outdoor Experimenter Kit (Light and Air)</h2>

<p>If you watch the film <a class="cow-url" href="http://chasingice.co.uk/">Chasing Ice</a> you can't fail
to be amazed when a vast chunk of glacier the size of Manhattan suddenly
disintegrates before your eyes. What are the climate changes that have
triggered these massive events? How do they play out in the air we're
breathing? How do you measure atmospheric conditions, and what science can we
use to explain changes in those conditions?</p>

<p>Meet <a class="cow-url" href="http://airpi.es/">AirPi</a>, a brilliant Pi-based atmospheric monitoring
kit that ran a crowdfunding campaign in 2013 and started shipping in the
autumn. The <b>Outdoor Experimenter Light and Air Kit</b> includes an AirPi with
the mobile rig, all set to get out and about measuring temperature, relative
humidity, air pressure, light levels, smoke, and the concentrations of the
harmful gas pollutants carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, and plotting the
results direct to a webserver running on the Pi.</p>

<p>Here's <a class="cow-url" href="http://airpi.es/">the AirPi board</a>, sensor and indicator set:</p>

<p>From version 3 MoPi uses a different set of GPIO pins in order to avoid
conflicts with AirPi (thanks Tom Hartley, creator of AirPi, for his help with
this).</p>

<p>We've done <a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/tag/airpi.html">a lot of work with AirPi</a> and beefed up its

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-9.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">9.1. </span>A Possible Charging Circuit</h2>

<p>One feature that we didn't manage to get sufficient backing for was battery
charging. This feature would be a great addition to MoPi, but it turns out to
be pretty difficult. :-( In fact, charging with lots of different chemistries
may not be possible at all on a tiny device like the MoPi. (Most manufacturers
of charging ICs only support one chemistry per chip, for example, and some
only support charging a single cell per chip! Many chargers also rely on
having a temperature sensor in physical proximity to the batteries
themselves.)<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote18"><sup><a href="#footnote18">18</a></sup></span> The other challenge is that we've got a really
small surface area to work with on the PCB.</p>

<p>Still, a number of our backers want to use MoPi with a charger (e.g. to charge
batteries from solar panels during the day and then run on batteries
overnight), so we've been working on a configuration with an external charger.
For example, here's how we think a UPS configuration with charging could look:</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/dsguk8/ups-configuration/"><img class="cow-img" src="/pages/images/mopi/ups-with-charger.png" alt="UPS with charger" width="540" height="405"></a></p>

<p>We haven't tested this yet, but it <em>should</em> work. ;-)</p>

<p>There are a number of potential gotchas in this type of circuit. For example,
when the mains power drops, the Pi must be powered pretty much instantly in
order to avoid triggering a reboot. There are no big capacitors on the Pi's
PCB to buffer its consumption of 300-500 mA without power. To deal with this
requirement we need MoPi to be always on and monitoring the Pi's 5V feed, even
when that feed isn't being supplied by MoPi itself. (This doesn't waste much
power as our microcontroller is very efficient.) When MoPi sees the 5V rail
start to fall the controller immediately enables its 5V stabilizer, taking
over supply of power to the Pi.</p>

<p>In the circuit above, when there is mains, the charger is generating e.g. +12V
DC and the relay's coil is energized. The contact is switched to the normal
open position and is passing +12V to charge the batteries. When mains drops,
the relay is switching to the normal closed position and charging will stop.
MoPi is powered all the time &mdash; and so, we hope, is the Pi. (What does the
diode do? When the +12V goes down, accumulated energy in the relay's coil must
be dissipated. The diode is shorting the coil to do that. Otherwise the
relay's contact will stay closed for a longer time.)</p>

<p>More on this when we get time to test it out in practice.</p>

<p>In the meantime we've been working on various solar options... Watch

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-9.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">9.2. </span>Other Options</h2>

<p>For voltage regulation another option is a UBEC<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote19"><sup><a href="#footnote19">19</a></sup></span> &mdash; a device popular with
radio-controlled aircraft people, and hence nice and light-weight, and also
fairly cheap, e.g.:
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.giantshark.co.uk/hobbywing-3amp-ubec-p-402342.html">this one</a>,
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.modelaccessories.co.uk/hobbywing-3amp-ubec.html">this one</a> or
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.hobbyking.co.uk/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=28160">this one</a>. UBECs are switched-mode regulators, just like our MoPi regulator
board, so they don't waste power when converting high DC to 5 volt DC.</p>

supplies and their subtleties (and is generally an excellent investment for
the Pi enthusiast).</p>

<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-10."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">10. </span>Linux is Lovely</h1>

<p>One of the great things about the Pi is that it runs a <a class="cow-url" href="http://fsf.org/">free
and open source</a> software stack. This makes development so much easier &mdash;
and here's an example of why...</p>

<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-10.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">10.1. </span>Glitches in the Pi's I2C Bus</h2>

<p>The I2C bus is a great way to ship data between the Pi and add-on boards like
MoPi. It is also a bit of a pig to get working: the CPU in the Pi has a
hardware bug that causes intermittent bad reads from the bus. Quoting
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/254">Renata Wolff</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>
The broadcom BCM2835 has a (hardware) bug in the I2C module.</p>

<p>The BCM implements &quot;clock stretching&quot; in a bad way:</p>

<p>Instead of ensuring a minimum &quot;hightime&quot; for the clock, the BCM lets the I2C
clock internally run on, and when it's time to flip the clock again, it checks
wether or not the clock has become high, and if it is low, it does a &quot;clock
stretch&quot;. However if just in the few nanoseconds before this check the slave
releases the clock signal indicating it is ready for a new clock, the clock
pulse may become as short as 40ns. (that's the lowest I'm able to measure, and
that of course is quite rare). With a 100kHz (10 microseconds) I2C clock, the
&quot;bad&quot; moments to release the clock are 5 microseconds apart.
</blockquote></p>

<p>(See also <a class="cow-url" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3669512/2835_I2C%20interface.pdf">Gert
van Loo's description here</a>.) This took us a quite a few debug cycles to cope
with! Below some details of one of the methods used (the others involving lot
of sweating over a hot oscilloscope, trawling system logs and the like!).</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-10.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">10.2. </span>Installing I2C</h2>

<p>Now that MoPi uses I2C as its communication mechanism, we have to enable this
in the simbamon package. Here's how we do it<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote20"><sup><a href="#footnote20">20</a></sup></span>:</p>

<ul>
<li>if i2c-tools isn't already installed, install it:
  <ul>
  <li><tt>sudo apt-get install i2c-tools</tt></li>
  </ul></li>
<li>(you might as well do the same with <tt>python-smbus</tt> for testing purpose)</li>
<li>edit <tt>/etc/modules</tt> and add lines <tt>i2c-bcm2708</tt> and <tt>i2c-dev</tt></li>
<li>edit <tt>/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist</tt> (if it exists) and comment out the
  line <tt>blacklist i2c-bcm2708</tt> (by adding a <tt>#</tt> at the start of the line)</li>
</ul>

<p>(The <tt>postinst</tt> script in our Debian package for simbamon does all this for
you, by the way.)</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-10.3."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">10.3. </span>Debugging with I2C Tools</h2>

<p>The process of developing our interface involved hacking the <tt>i2c-tools</tt>
package to play with the multi-byte read facility in the <tt>i2cdump</tt> command.
On a closed-source operating system, of course, you would be stymied at this
point. On Linux it is super easy :-)</p>

<p>Here's how to pull down the source code, rebuild and test:</p>

<ul>
<li>edit <tt>/etc/apt/sources.lst</tt> and add this line:
  <ul>
  <li><tt>deb-src <a class="cow-url" href="http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/">http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/</a> wheezy main contrib
    non-free rpi</tt></li>
  </ul></li>
<li>then
  <ul>
  <li><tt>sudo apt-get update</tt></li>
  <li><tt>mkdir i2c-tools</tt></li>
  <li><tt>cd i2c-tools</tt></li>
  <li><tt>apt-get source i2c-tools</tt></li>
  </ul></li>
<li>then <tt>make</tt> will recompile (the tools are in the directory <tt>tools</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey presto, I can hack away at the C code and get immediate feedback with
commands like <tt>sudo tools/i2cdump -y 1 0x0b i</tt> (where <tt>0x0b</tt> is MoPi's
designated I2C address &mdash; the smart battery address)<span class="cow-footnote" name="footnote21"><sup><a href="#footnote21">21</a></sup></span>.</p>
