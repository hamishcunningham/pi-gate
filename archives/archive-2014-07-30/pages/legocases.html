<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.lego.com/en-gb/">LEGO</a> is an amazing thing. I spent large chunks
of time in my childhood playing with these magic bricks. It's one of the few
toys out there I think that really lets your imagination have free reign. The
things you can do range from building detailed models to the abstract. Who's
to say that two bricks aren't a ship? But I digress.</p>
<p>In June of last year <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/author/liz">Liz
Upton</a> posted on <a class="cow-url" href="http://raspberrypi.org">RaspberryPi.org</a> a set of
directions <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1354">for building a LEGO Pi
case</a>, by a kid called Biz. I was enchanted. Why hadn't I thought of this
earlier? Building a case of LEGO was a fantastic idea. Even better I still
have all my LEGO bricks. Only they're all at my parents house, so I had to put
the project on hold. But now I've got the opportunity to share a bit about
building my case after having finally gotten around to picking up my kit.</p>
<p>While we're at it I'll also do a little overview of some of the other cases
out there. Maybe put my <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/civil">Civil Engineering
degree</a> to some use, eh? Because really, a set of directions for a specific
case takes away a lot of the fun of LEGO I think. Yes, every set you can get
comes with directions, but it's often what you do afterwards that really
starts the magic. So instead of a specific set of directions, I'm going to
talk design features and limitations.</p>
<p>My goal here is not to say &quot;here's how you build a case&quot; but, like the Pi
itself, to tickle your imagination into thinking how you might take the LEGO
you've got and build your own case. The number one reason for doing this? I
saw Biz's directions and immediately thought, &quot;Awesome. Only I don't have
those bricks and I can't afford to get them.&quot; (Being a poor University student
does have it's downsides.) No matter &mdash; just grab what you've got and dive in!</p>
<p><a name="mycase"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>The case I built and why</h1>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/01case.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/01case.jpg" alt="My case" width="200" height="150"></a>
<a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/01caseb.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/01caseb.jpg" alt="My case 2" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Because of my degree I approached building my case with a specific set of
design goals. Criteria I wanted to meet and the like. After reviewing Biz's
case and deciding I didn't have the pieces, I considered building a clone.
That is the same final design, but using different pieces. Unfortunately, I
felt that I wanted the case to perform in ways I thought Biz's design didn't
accomplish.</p>
<p>I was a little worried about how sturdy the design was. At that point in time
I was doing quite a bit of travelling and I wanted my case to be able to
travel with me. Travelling means surviving either banging around in checked
luggage or in my backpack. Neither of them the best environment for precision
electronics. That also meant I needed to design a case that protects the
Pi's ports.</p>
<p>I also felt that getting the cover off would be a pain. That sucker is held
down proper and if I ever wanted to look inside to admire the pretty
electronics, or mess with the GPIO, I was gonna have a bad time. The case
should also be no larger than necessary and look cool. (That meant keeping
Biz's logo in some way &mdash; that bit is awesome.)</p>
<p>So just like a real Civil Engineering project I found myself with a balancing
act. I needed to balance my design goals against the bricks I actually had. And
similar to a proper project I had my own set of design codes to follow. You
don't just willy-nilly pour concrete floors and hope they don't crack. In the
same way I don't just put bricks on top of each other.</p>
<p>Specifically, I don't allow for multiple vertical cracks to align. This makes
for what's called in Civil Engineering a plane of weakness or a slip surface.
A place where a material will slide with little to no effort. In LEGO this
translates to what you build falling apart at awkward times. Usually bad news,
and definitely so when sturdiness is a goal.</p>
<p><a name="details"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.1."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.1. </span>Design details</h2>
<p>Essentially my case can be considered a derivative of Biz's design, so again,
a tip of the hat to her. The easiest possible modification was a way to get
the top off easier. Simply replacing a portion of the outer rim with the tile
pieces achieves this effect. All of it can be tile, or only a portion as I've
done. The former will have the lid just sitting on, which is great for easy
access. The few studs I've left is a perfect compromise for travel.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/02empty.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/02empty.jpg" alt="Partially
tiled" width="200" height="150"></a>
<a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/03empty.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/03empty.jpg" alt="Partially
tiled 2" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>For port access you can see I've used shuttered windows. The RCA, VGA, and
HDMI ports all extend from the circuit board of the Pi, and the shuttered
windows provide solid cover for them without having to extend the case wall
away from the board at all. A small window has been used to let the diagnostic
lights be seen. </p>
<p>You can also see that the positioning of the risers on the bottom is different
than Biz's. These were chosen to be in locations where there is nothing
soldered onto the bottom of the Pi's circuit board. This lets it sit smoothly
and evenly.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/04pieces.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/04pieces.jpg" alt="Exploded
view" width="200" height="150"></a>
<a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/05pieces.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/05pieces.jpg" alt="Exploded
view 2" width="200" height="112"></a></p>
<p>There is also a bit of tile in red at the southern area of the bottom. This
supports the SD card and the card slot. The 2x1 in red at the north and south
minimise the area from the two fully exposed ports &mdash; the ethernet and micro
USB. When designing I could find no good way to protect every single port.
These two are the two that are most likely to be used full time in my use
cases so they got left exposed.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/06pi.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/06pi.jpg" alt="Pi sitting" width="200" height="112"></a></p>
<p>The Pi is also lifted up an extra 1/3rd tile on its risers. This is for
multiple reasons. It allows for: better support of the SD card; airflow
underneath the board; the GPIO pins won't hit stud heads; the ports line up in
the window frames better; and finally, it allows for a side panel piece to be
placed. This is critical, as this is the piece primarily responsible for
keeping the board from wiggling when you plug things in and during travel.
Also note that the base is 2/3rds thick &mdash; this is extra sturdy &mdash; but due to
the interlocking thin tiles it isn't too bulky.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/07lid.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/07lid.jpg" alt="Pi sitting" width="200 150"></a>
<a class="cow-url" href="/static/pages/images/case/08pi.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs/08pi.jpg" alt="Pi sitting" width="200 150"></a></p>
<p>You'll also have noticed that this lid is rather bulky. This is what keeps the
Pi from shifting vertically in the case. It also comes down inside the main
case walls on the other sides of the windows to make plugging cables in
easier. Finally it provides protection at the top. Those clear tiles in the
sides are pure decoration &mdash; I also didn't have enough 1x1x1/3rd pieces to
make up the gaps. </p>
<p><a name="building"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2.2."></a><h2 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2.2. </span>Building it</h2>
<p>Hopefully you've got an idea now of what I've built, but I'm not going to
give explicit directions on how to build this case. I want to share the fun I
have with LEGO, which is the creation process. Finding just the right
combination of pieces. Picking out the colors. I think from the photos that
most of it can be built anyway with a bit of sense.</p>
<p>The other thing is that as far as I know some of the pieces I've used you
can't get new anymore. That may make it extra hard to build. You'll either
have to find them in your collection or find them second hand. I've found
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/631-1">Peeron</a> to be pretty good. eBay may
work as well. Maybe you can find substitute parts on the LEGO
<a class="cow-url" href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Pick-A-Brick-ByTheme#suppressXlink">Pick a Brick</a>
page.</p>
<p>I will say in general that what I did was find enough 1/3rd height pieces in
gray to make up a solid 2/3rd thick base. (This means no slip surfaces!) At
this point if the risers are stuck on and the Pi put into position, and this
reveals where the windows should go. The walls were built up around to match
the window heights. Smooth tiles were used over the window tops to keep them
in position and the few studed white bricks over the rest to anchor the roof.</p>
<p>The roof itself was built more or less seperately, after the rest of the case
was constructed. A 1/3rd thick loose conglomeration of red bricks to make a
solid cover was collected, and a second 1/3rd layer placed below (level with
the white rim) to tie it together without making the case any higher. That's
probably sufficient, but as I mentioned before I built it down more in order
to make the case sturdier.</p>
<p><a name="othercases"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>Other cases</h1>
<p>Now, as I've said it may be tricky to build my case because of parts issues.
Hopefully though, you now have an idea of why I've made the descisions I
have. What sorts of things to consider. It might also by the by give you a
little appreciation of what Civil Engineers consider when designing a new
building. I think this gives you the power to build your own case to your own
specification.</p>
<p>You now know what sort of thing to look for and what you might want to put in
or do with your case and can consciously aim for that. But don't just be
limited by what I've done. Let's take a look at some other designs out there
that I found while googling &quot;raspberry pi LEGO case&quot; &mdash; there are plenty of
results. Here are a few things I found really cool while looking at them all.
(I've included a list of even more cases at the end of the article.)</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rooreynolds/7155708427/sizes/l/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/labels.jpg" alt="Labels!" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>I love the use of tiles for labelling. This case is also one of the ones that
I'm now thinking of as &quot;half height&quot; &mdash; Primarily only 2 bricks tall as
opposed to the three that Biz and I have both used.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/attilaacs/8060076112/sizes/l/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/shutters.jpg" alt="Shutters!" width="200" height="132"></a></p>
<p>Someone else had the same idea and used shutters! I'm thrilled! Also another
nice red, green, white colour scheme going on.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/7157136321/sizes/l/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/sculpture.jpg" alt="Sculpture!" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>LEGO really is only limited by your imagination. Turn your case into a work
of art!</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/06/my-raspberry-pi-lego-case/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/slick.jpg" alt="Slick!" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>I like how slick this back panel feels. It also lets you get away with a
slightly shorter case.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://sparky0815.de/2012/05/raspberry-pi-lego-case-uberarbeitet-3/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/notch.jpg" alt="Notch!" width="200" height="133"></a></p>
<p>This notch on the etherport is nice. Gets away from a rectangle case. The
windows on the top make really stylish vents and the little Pi logo is there
too!</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.weekendcontent.com/how-to-make-your-own-lego-raspberry-pi-computer-case/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/hinge.jpg" alt="Hinge!" width="200" height="109"></a></p>
<p>Consider as well that the lid of the case doesn't have to be fixed or
resting, that it might be hinged as well!</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://glynrob.com/hardware/my-lego-pi-case/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/open.jpg" alt="Open!" width="200" height="141"></a></p>
<p>The open bottom here I thought was pretty clever. A nice way to lighten up
the case or save on finding bricks for the bottom.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jole/sets/72157630028613267/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/roof.jpg" alt="Roof!" width="200" height="133"></a></p>
<p>The top doesn't have to be flat. Sloped roof bricks have been used to good
effect. Loads of extras make this one into another example of a work of art.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://anoved.net/2013/06/raspberry-pi-lego-case/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/slide.jpg" alt="Slide!" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Rather than open out the top, the Pi slides in and out. Clever detailing to
make that work and fix the Pi in place.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lego-Raspberry-Pi-Case/"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/pages/images/case/thumbs_ext/vents.jpg" alt="Vents!" width="200" height="133"></a></p>
<p>Ah, LEGO Technic. I don't know if it was intended this way, but the Technic
holes form perfect vents for passive cooling. Very clever use of the doors
to cover the ports. If I had some of these pieces I think I'd want to do it
this way.</p>
