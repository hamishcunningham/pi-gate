<p>OK, it's been a while. For those that don't remember, the <a class="cow-url" href="http://airpi.es/">AirPi</a> is a low-cost weather station add-on project for the Raspberry Pi. I've
previously written about <a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/posts/2014/02/07/airpi1/">building it from
scratch</a>, <a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/posts/2014/02/14/airpiupdate/">soldering it up</a>, and then most
recently <a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/posts/2014/02/25/airpisensors/">interpreting sensor readings</a>.
Since then I've been working on making those readings more accessible.</p>
<p>That's the beauty of open source software and projects really. Tom Hartley (the
AirPi guy) posted their software on <a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/tomhartley/AirPi">GitHub</a>, an open software source code repository. I
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/guruthree/AirPi">forked it</a>, or created a copy of the
code, to make my own modifications. After two months of on and off again
changes and testing, I feel it's about as done as it's going to get.</p>
<p>My goal here is to introduce everyone to what I think are the really nifty
things I've added in. I've fixed a few bugs in the original code as I've found
them. I've also then fixed the bugs I introduced myself in the new code, but we
can gloss over them... The big fix I think is the high CPU load the software
had, which only needed the addition of a simple <tt>time.sleep()</tt> to make it more
reasonable.</p>
<p>The first of the new features is <b>Raingauge Support</b>. Previously I
<a class="cow-non-existant-url" href="/posts/2014/01/25/raingauge/">looked at them</a>, and now I've translated the
logging code I wrote there and applied it to the AirPi framework. We've just
gotten even more weather-station-esqe. Just connect the raingauge to GPIO pin
17 and ground. In a similar vein I also added back in support for the <b>TGS-2600
Air Quality Sensor</b> and the <b>UVI-01 Ultra Violet Sensor</b>. This was all pretty
trivial still. This was all mostly just extensions of what was already there.</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/images/environment/software/raingauge2.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/environment/software/raingauge2_thumb.jpg"></a>
<em>The raingauge connection...</em></p>
<p>On to more exciting things! Last time I more or less pointed out that a chunk
of the sensor readings were uncalibrated. Not anymore! There's now a module
that let's the software output calibrated readings. &quot;What's the use?&quot; you
might say? Ah well, for starters I also added a CSV output module. The AirPi
is now compatible with industry standard file formats... also known as a
(comma separated value) spreadsheet. It get's better than that though:</p>
<p>... (wait for it) ... The Crown Jewels:</p>
<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/images/environment/software/webinterface.png"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/environment/software/webinterface_small.png"></a></p>
<p>Instead of uploading to Xively, which requires Internet access and relies on a
third-party service, I've <b>built in an HTTP server</b>. Starting the AirPi
software with this module enabled starts the Pi listening on port 8080
for HTTP requests. Going there loads up a pretty, but fast site that's based
on <a class="cow-url" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>But wait! There's more!</p>

<p>Not only can you see the current reading, you can also view graphs.
Interactively explore what the weather's been doing over the last 24 hours
with the click of a button. This is of course customizable. You could show the
last hour or the last 2 weeks, but longer periods require more free memory and
will load a bit slower. Check out our <b><a class="cow-url" href="/pages/airpi-files/airpi_demo/">interactive demo site</a></b>. It's not a real Pi there for reasons of my router
being unhappy, but it behaves just like the real thing. Open the drop down to
bring up a graph. Select an area on a graph to zoom.</p>
<p>Sharp eyed observes will have also noticed the RSS feed icon in the upper right
hand corner. This is to allow for easy export of results to other software. I
suspect minimal modifications will allow
<a class="cow-url" href="https://github.com/uduncanu/AirPi/commit/9e13c3ab0e902d563a78e98addc7aac6eda5a35e">this JSON output</a> module to be served over HTTP for easy export as well.</p>
<p>The reason I was after RSS? How many people have heard of
<a class="cow-url" href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky</a>? It's a system monitor applet that
displays system information on the screen in a corner of the desktop. It's a
bit like the gadgets of Windows Vista/7 or OS X dashboard widgets. Well,
anyway Conky, like gadgets or widgets, supports RSS feeds.</p>

<p>Adding the above bit of config to the end of my <tt>.conkyrc</tt> file gives me this
(below) in the upper right corner of my desktop. The weather on my terms. Just
what an AirPi should do.</p>
