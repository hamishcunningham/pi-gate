<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Computers in the World</h1>

<p>The real world is saturated with computer code. It's in everything from
fridges to singing birthday cards. Right now, you are standing in a place rich
in <a class="cow-url" href="http://youtu.be/bfkCdir-yO8">geospatial data</a>, where if you can get a
mobile signal you can upload a photograph,
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tag it</a>, and let your friends
know what it feels like. Unless you cycle, or use a very old car, you'll be
depending on computers to get to wherever you're going next. </p>

<p>But forget about the real world for a minute. Think about how much of your
life goes on in virtual spaces. Shopping, booking appointments, catching up
with friends, looking for the next thing to do &mdash; or the next person to do it
with. Think about how many of the messages that shape your thinking arrive
through
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.pbs.org/teachers/digital-media-literacy/pbs-resources/understanding-media-messages/">digital media</a>.</p>

<p>In a very real sense, the people who write our code, create our world.
And the power of code is only going to get bigger. Shouldn't everyone
have the chance to create their own world, and not simply wander
through the creations of other people? Because that is really the
choice &mdash; to <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.rushkoff.com/program-or-be-programmed/">programme
or be programmed</a>.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>Computers in Education</h1>

<p>When the first computers started appearing in
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language#Explosive_growth:_the_home_computer_era">homes and schools</a>, back in the late 1970s, that was what kids used them for
&mdash; programming. OK the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anachrocomputer/4721079554/">graphics were
rubbish</a>, and the language &mdash;
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language">BASIC</a> &mdash; was far
from elegant, but computing was creative, it was hands-on, it was even
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/09/feature_ten_sexy_computers_roundup/page5.html">quite cool</a>.</p>

<p>Today the UK Government believes in '<em>preparing children for the digital
world</em>', especially if the UK is to keep up with emerging economies where
schools focus on computer skills from an early age. In fact, children already
live in a digital world. They are quick to pick up and use whatever devices
they have around them. Where schools come in is giving them a different way of
thinking about computers. A way of <em>creating and participating</em> as well as
consuming digital media. Of understanding how computers work, and how they
shape our way of life.</p>

<p>A recent European <a class="cow-url" href="http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/20130419_en.htm">survey
of ICT in education</a> found that teachers and students alike are keen to make
more creative use of computers. But teachers often lack the specialist
training they need, and there may not be enough computers to go round, or
enough time in the curriculum to cover more than the basics.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>Computers in the UK Curriculum</h1>

<p>This is where the new UK
<a class="cow-url" href="http://academy.bcs.org/sites/academy.bcs.org/files/ICT%20POS%20Final%20Draft%2030%20Nov%202012_0.pdf">ICT Curriculum for Schools</a> comes in. Though the debate goes on, it seems
certain this will include a much stronger element of
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>. That's
understanding how computers work and making them do things, to you and me.
It's writing your own apps and games, creating animations, or carrying out
some of the <a class="cow-url" href="/pages/basics.html">projects</a> you'll find on this site. That has to be
good news for students with an interest in getting beyond word processing or
spreadsheets and finding out How Stuff Works for a change.</p>

<p>But it might be good news for other subject areas too. Understanding how
digital systems work means thinking logically, and often mathematically.
Patterns in data can open our eyes to the world around us &mdash; to how birds
flock, or populations grow, or economic crises play out. And whether we are
writing elegant programs or building fabulous digital artefacts, using
computers can develop our creativity, our concentration and our artistry.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, the new curriculum asks schools to build '<em>a
critical understanding of technology's impact on the individual and society</em>'.
How much easier that is if you have been behind the screen, and had a chance
to experience hands-on how these amazing, world-creating tools work.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>Why the Pi?</h1>

<p>The Raspberry Pi is a computer that schools don't need to worry about kids
breaking, or abusing, or using to endanger their safety &mdash; providing they are
careful with the soldering iron. The Pi is designed to spend much of its life
in pieces. It runs a free, open source operating system (Linux) and uses the
cheapest components that are robust enough to do the job. But the Pi is mainly
cheap because it isn't a finished, out-of-the-box product. It's a project &mdash;
or rather, it's a series of projects. Getting it to do the many useful things
it can do requires brainwork and some old-fashioned skills of the hand. </p>

<p>The Pi isn't just a programming device, though. The processor is powerful
enough to support excellent multimedia, making it attractive to kids who are
into design and animation as well. With a range of devices and add-ons, it can
be many different things &mdash; a robot remote control, a
<a class="cow-url" href="/pages/basics.html#parent-alarm">parent alarm</a>, a window on the
internet. And the Pi can be used for home-school learning: light and robust
enough to be carried in a school bag, cheap enough for kids to have one each.
It also has its own <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/">community</a> where
anyone can share projects and swap ideas, so kids can see people doing what
they are doing for schoolwork, for fun.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->
<a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-5."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">5. </span>Getting Started With Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>By now you probably have your own ideas about how the Pi could be valuable in
your school curriculum. But you know the technology by itself isn't going to
going to provide a great learning experience. How do teachers get confident
and skilful enough to make programming fun? Who can help them to see the
opportunities across the curriculum, not just in ICT? </p>

<p>We'll return to this in later posts &mdash; watch this space!</p>
