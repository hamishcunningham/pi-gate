<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->


<p>A year or two ago I connected a small 132x32 pixel LCD display to one of my
Raspberry Pis. The idea behind it was that I could use it to display small
status updates or anything else I wanted. Mostly from that aspect it ended up
being a clock.</p>


<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/images/3d/tv/clock_big.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/clock_small.jpg" alt="A rather fancy clock"></a></p>

<p>Once I got some code written for text, my next thought was &quot;could I do video?&quot;
There were a few hurdles there to overcome as well. Codec? Framerate? I ended
making up a solution where I read in 2-bit (black and white) bitmap image and
displayed it. Repeat 24 times a second and you have video.</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/frames.gif" alt="Raw frames">
<img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/video.gif" alt="Video in action"></p>

<p>I noticed something interesting though, in that I could push out images a lot
faster than 24 FPS. I could reach just over the 120 FPS. This is the magic
number for what's known as
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shutter_3D_system">active 3D TV</a>. In
Active 3D, the special glasses effectively blank out one eye than the other
rapidly. At the same time the TV is showing the left eye, right, left, right,
etc., at the same speed. (3D in movie theatres, for example
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealD_Cinema">RealD 3D</a>, typically uses
polarized light.)</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/animation.gif" alt="Active 3D"></p>

<p>There are two ways that active glasses are controlled by TVs. The first,
impractical way is radio. Typically Bluetooth. The other way, which fits right
in the realm of hacker electronics, is Infrared. (Just like a remote control!)
Knowing this then I needed a was an infrared transmission from the Pi to the
glasses, and then to match this up with the software I'd already written to
display video. The latter, is easy. The former, not so much so.</p>

<p>The first stumbling block is the infrared transmission signal. Like a remote
control, it's also a specially coded signal. And like for TVs, many makers
have different signals for their glasses. Fortunately, someone has already
made an
<a class="cow-url" href="http://cmst.curtin.edu.au/local/docs/pubs/2011-17-woods-helliwell-3D-Sync-IR.pdf">analysis</a> of the different signals using an oscilloscope. I managed to find a
reasonably priced pair of nVidia 3D glases. The protocol for them looks like
this:</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/nvidia protocol.png" alt="nVidia 3D glasses Infrared Protocol"></p>

<p>Unfortunately the timing of those infrared pulses is in <em>micro</em>seconds. This is
a small problem. The Pi can't consistently execute code at microsecond timing.
Millisecond's about the best it can do because Raspbian isn't what's called a
<a class="cow-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system">Real-time operating
system</a>. It spends a lot of time instead cycling between different tasks, any
of which can call for CPU time at any moment and interrupting whatever else is
happening.</p>

<p>In a real-time situation like sending a infrared signal, we can't have the
kernel deciding to take a pause in the middle to do something else.
Fortunately, most microcontrollers are real-time, and so will do exactly
what you tell them to in the order you tell them to.
<a class="cow-url" href="http://morethanuser.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/ir-remote-emulator-with-attiny45.html">More Than User</a> used an attiny45 to create an infrared remote. I haven't got
one of those, but I do have a
<a class="cow-url" href="https://estore.ti.com/EZ430-F2013-MSP430-USB-Stick-Development-Tool-P800.aspx">EZ430-F2013</a> which is this crazy TI micro-controller in a USB stick format
thing.</p>

<p><a class="cow-url" href="/static/images/3d/tv/ez430_big.jpg"><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/ez430_small.jpg" alt="The EZ430"></a></p>

<p>The EZ430 is very nice in that it comes with a proper development environment
and a &quot;let's blink the LED&quot; code example&mdash;blinking an Infrared LED is what I
wanted to do after all! What I really needed to do then was to learn how to
control blink timing precisely. Things now get a little technical.
Microcontroller programming isn't exactly easy and this was new ground for me.</p>

<p>Eventually I learned that the EZ430 has an onboard 8 MHz clock crystal. What's
neat about this is that you can do something called a <em>timer interrupt</em>. There
are different ways to go about it, but in general in this case I tell the
EZ430 to count down from X to 0, which X is the number of clock ticks. If I
could put in the number 8,000,000 for X, I'd have an exact timing of 1 second.</p>

<p>It's not quite that easy though. The counter is only a 16-bit integer which
means I can only count down from 32,767. Fortunately there are clock dividers
available which let you tweak it around. The catch here is that the protocol
has <em>half</em>microsecond timing. That means I can't divide down directly to 1
MHz timing, and instead can only divide down to 2 MHz timing. My counter then
has to be twice the numbers shown in the protocol diagram.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
// set up the timer
DCOCTL = CALDCO_8MHZ;
BCSCTL1 = CALBC1_8MHZ;
BCSCTL2 |= DIVS_2; // divide by 4
TACTL = TASSEL_2 + MC_1 + ID_0;
</pre>At this point I could control the glasses! I was thrilled! The next challenge
then arrises: connecting this to the Pi. Enter <em>input pin interrupts</em>. The
EZ430 has 8 digital input/output pins. One of them is used as an output for
the infrared LED to talk to the glasses. Another pin I changed to an input,
and then enabled a <em>rising edge</em> interrupt on it. This means as soon as voltage
at the pin is detected it triggers a code call. From this I can then start the
timer and open one eye and close the other.</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
// setup interrupt on pin 3
P1IE = BIT3;
P1IES &amp;= ~BIT3; // rising edge
_EINT();
</pre>Hurrah! I connect the input pin on the EZ430 to a GPIO output from the Pi and
I have glasses control. Now in my video program after a frame is drawn I simply
turn the connected GPIO pin on and off again, triggering an interrupt on the
EZ430, which ends up sending an infred signal to the glasses. Gives a very good
feeling. It may have taken 10 minutes to read this far but it took hours to
learn what I needed on the EZ430 on work it all out.</p>

<p><img class="cow-img" src="/static/images/3d/tv/schematic.png" alt="Devices Schematic"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, my 3D TV doesn't work. As near as I can tell all the electronics
are fine. I just missed one thing. Despite the fact that I can push out 120 FPS
to the LCD there's still a lag for the crystals to change (this is the &quot;response
time&quot; you might have seen advertised on your monitor). The timing on the little
LCD I installed is far greater than the 8 milliseconds needed. Maybe there's a
way around needing 120 FPS for the glasses, but I haven't exactly worked it out
yet. So far now the bits and pieces sit on my desk. A good idea and fun to do.
Close yes, but no cigar. </p>
