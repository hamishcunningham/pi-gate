<p>Our Kickstarter has got off to a flying start (thanks to all our backers!) :-)</p>
<h2 class="cow-heading">[MoPi is <b>mobile</b>, <b>hot-swap</b> and <b>24/7 power</b> for the Raspberry Pi.
<a class="cow-url" href="/pages/get-mopi.html">How to order.</a>]</h2>

<p>Now that we know we can deliver the basic device we've defined <em>Stretch Goals</em>
to add to the crowdfunding project. They include a bunch of improvements,
extra functions and extra rewards that we can deliver if we attract more
backers. They're now up on the main page &mdash; <a class="cow-url" href="http://tinyurl.com/mobile-pi">http://tinyurl.com/mobile-pi</a> and
scroll down to Section 5 near the end &mdash; and here:</p>

<p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-1."></a><h1 class="cow-title-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">1. </span>Stretch Goals</h1>

<p>Thanks to our backers so far we're going beyond our baseline. We've figured
out a bunch of extras we can offer in MoPi if we get further (and the level of
funding we'll need to make them viable):</p>

<ul>
<li>150% (unlocked!): <b>screw terminals</b>, <b>stackable headers</b>, <b>remoting pads</b>
  and <b>self-resetting fuse</b> added</li>
<li>175% (nearly there!): <b>two-way communication</b> and <b>remote power-off</b> added</li>
<li>200%: <b>3.3V supply</b> mod added</li>
<li>250%: <b>timer-based wake-up</b> added</li>
<li>300%: <b>The PiBrush</b> reward released</li>
<li>375%: <b>battery charging</b> added</li>
<li>430%: <b>The HackCam</b> reward released</li>
<li>590%: <b>input voltage boost</b> added</li>
<li>999%: <b>The Pablet</b> reward released</li>
</ul>

<p>When we reach <u>150% funded</u> (nearly there!) we can make these improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Screw terminals</b>. This will make it easier to connect all different types
  of power supply (from batteries to water turbines) direct to MoPi.</li>
<li><b>Stackable headers</b>. We'll put a stacking header directly onto the board
  (and adopt the same case lid style as for the
  <a class="cow-url" href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/model-a-pibow">Pibow Model A</a>). This
  will make it easier to connect multiple boards at once (e.g. MoPi + XLoBorg,
  or MoPi + AirPi, or etc.).</li>
<li><b>Remoting pads</b>. We'll add remoting pads for the power switch to help with
  applications where MoPi sits away from the edge of the case. This will allow
  the connection of an additional power switch.</li>
<li><b>Self-resetting fuse</b>. MoPi supplies power directly through the GPIO pins,
  which bypasses the Pi's built-in fuse. We think this is safe &mdash; but to be
  doubly sure we'll add a fuse in MoPi.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we get to <u>175% funded</u> we will add:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Two-way communication</b>. We're moving to I2C for communication between the
  Pi and MoPi, which will mean complete configurability from the Pi. (It will
  also minimise our use of GPIO pins and maximise the number of other Pi
  add-on boards that we can run with.)</li>
<li><b>Remote power off</b>. You'll be able to tell MoPi to power down the Pi when
  logged-in remotely (after a clean shutdown, of course).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we get to <u>200% funded</u> we will add the ability to mod MoPi for <b>3.3V
operation</b> (overpowering the Pi's on-board regulator and saving the power that
is dissipated there, for weight and battery life critical applications like
ballooning).</p>

<p>If we make it to <u>250% funded</u> we'll add timer-based wakeup &mdash; tell MoPi
what time you want your Pi to wakeup, then power it down and MoPi will boot
the Pi as requested.</p>

<p>If we get to <u>300% funded</u> we will offer our virtual paintbrush rig &mdash; <b>The
<a class="cow-url" href="http://pi.gate.ac.uk/pages/pibrush.html">PiBrush</a></b> &mdash; as a reward. PiBrush
combines a MoPi with an accelerometer and is a great way to engage kids with
Python programming and the physics of motion. When you've got one you've also
got a programmable Pi-based Wii-remote-alike, and there are a ton of cool
applications waiting.</p>

<p>Now, the one you've all been waiting for: <b>charging</b>! That's by a long head
our most requested feature &mdash; but it is also pretty difficult :-(  In fact,
dealing with lots of different chemistries may not be possible on a tiny
device like MoPi (most manufacturers of charging ICs only support one
chemistry per chip, for example, and some only support charging a <em>single
cell</em> per chip!). The other challenge is that we've got a really small surface
area to work with on the PCB. So we need to get quite a bit further to have
the necessary resources... but if we reach <u>375% funding</u>, then we'll do it!
We're not promising to charge every battery under the sun, but we'll provide
charging for at least one popular configuration.</p>

<p>If we make it to <u>430% funded</u> we'll offer <b>The HackCam</b>, a Model A Pi, a
camera module, wifi and a MoPi, wrapped up in a water-resistant box with a 3
inch screen and the switching to make it work in the way you'd expect. The
pictures are served directly to the web by an Apache running on the Pi, and
with everything open source (of course) you can tweak the photographic
parameters to your heart's content. A camera you can log in to!</p>

<p>Some applications would benefit from the addition of a
<b>voltage boost</b>, e.g. when you've got a small surface area of photo-voltaic
(solar) panel and want to trickle charge a backup battery. If we reach <u>590%
funding</u> we'll add a buck booster to cater for these applications.</p>

<p>Finally (for now!) if we get to <u>999% funding</u> we'll offer <b>The Pablet</b>,
combining MoPi with this
<a class="cow-url" href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pitft-pibow">touchscreen and case rig</a>.
We'll mod the case to add a couple of PP3 clips, and an external power switch.
Hey presto! a Pi-based &quot;tablet&quot;!</p>

<p>(And if we reach 4000% Lubo says we can attach a rocket to it, though I'm a
little suspicious that he's not totally sincere on that one.)</p>
