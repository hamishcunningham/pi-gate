<p><a name="apc"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-2."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">2. </span>APC 8750</h1>

<p>The APC 8750 is big and clunky. It's a big fat board with a big fat power
brick to go along with it. But it does some good things with that space.
Primarily, ports. Ports everywhere. VGA output for old screens, enough USB
ports so that you don't have to have a hub. Good things. There's also a
proper power button on the circuit board. Speaking of which it's also ATX
compatibile, which means there's a slew of cases out there it will fit in,
even if they will be way bigger than necessary.</p>

<p>While the APC 8750 ships with Android it does run Linux, and in this case
it's actually Rasbian. Write the <a class="cow-url" href="http://www.raspbian.org/ApricotImages">image</a> to an microSD card and then pause. Because it's a pretty much packed
2GB image it really needs to be resized up after being written. I ran out of
space running apt updates because I didn't.</p>

<p>After boot it's a relatively snappy setup. It doesn't stick out as &quot;wow
that's fast but it doesns't make me cringe a lot either. The system really is
just par for the course. The only exception is an apparent bug that keeps the
system from booting if there's no monitor attached. That cuts down on a lot
of use cases for a low power system. There also aren't any sort of GPIO
headers so there's nothing doing on that front.</p>

<p>Ultimately I see the system as a desktop replacement for scenarios where you
don't need the power of a proper desktop. A PC that sits in the kitchen
playing music is where I would put it. That's just what pops into my head
though, doubtless other folks will have other good ideas.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="bbb"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-3."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">3. </span>BeagleBone Black</h1>

<p>About the size of a Pi, the BeagleBone Black is a hacker's board, pure and
simple. Primary evidence of this comes in the guise of more I/O pins than one
can conviently shake a stick at. More evidence comes along as you get up and
running with it. It ships with a stripped down Angstrom linux, but for
comparative purposes I've put
<a class="cow-url" href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu#Quantal_12.10_armhf">Ubuntu</a> on it.
The install approach is somewhat different. Rather than writing a pure image,
there's a script which formats the card and extracts a system image archive.
To my mind it's a much more Gentoo like approach.</p>

<p>To boot off the SD card you need to hold down a little button by it.
Unfortunately to me this wasn't obvious at first, so I spent quite a while
wondering what was going on until I figured that out. Oops moment there.
Apparently this can be fixed so that the SD card is the default boot location
with a uBoot flash. Another thing smacking of hackery.</p>

<p>Once the system boots, you're in a frame buffer console. Forunately a script
is provided to apt-get install LXDE for you to get up and running in GUI
land. Ethernet works right off the bat and it was a relatively quick install.
After it was up the GUI experience is a bit below average. Like most of these
systems, it's a framebuffer driver for Xorg, so one expects a lower level of
performance. In that sense responsiveness was average. What was poorer was
the occaisional glitching of the screen, wrapping around horizontally a few
pixels. Impressions were not helped with the two system lock ups I
experienced, both of which occurred on the same imgur page - in two different
browsers. All of this adds to the feeling of it's a hackers system.
You'd need an incredible patient child to get through all of this.</p>

<p>Hardware wise it's respectable, although the close placemnt of the micro HDMI
and USB port mean connectors bump heads. No sound means it won't be a media
center, but the comprehensive LEDs (Power, CPU, SD, and MMC activity) and
buttons on the board are a nice touch. Overall (and I won't get tired of
saying this I think) everything points it towards being a hacker's system.
Three years ago it would probably have been my choice for a project if I had
one, but I wouldn't have gotten it on an impulse like the Pi. At this point I
think I'd need something really, really specific to get one now.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="cubie"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-4."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">4. </span>Cubieboard</h1>

<p>The Cubieboard is just a little bit bigger than a Pi, and for taking up a
similar amount of space, they've jammed a whole lot of stuff in there. A lot
of expansion pins, but also audio in and out, SATA, IR... It's impressive.
The board I've got came in what's called the &quot;rich packaging&quot; which includes
some nice extras like a cardboard case, SATA power cable, and a debugging
serial cable.</p>

<p>Getting up and going is quick with the default Android install and runs well.
There are a variety of
<a class="cow-url" href="http://linux-sunxi.org/Install_Ubuntu_Linux_for_Cubieboard">Ubuntu</a>
options for the board but only one easy SD card lubuntu. I've gone ahead and
installed that. The image size is large, but comes with pretty much
everything installed. Apparently
<a class="cow-url" href="http://cubieboard.org/2012/11/15/install-ubuntu-with-berryboot/">Berryboot</a>
makes more distributions available, but I haven't tested this.</p>

<p>Usable performance is par for the course, and there's plenty of free memory
after the system finishes booting into LXDE. What's a nice feature is that
the board can properly turn off from a &quot;sudo poweroff&quot; command and then has
a power button to get it started again. On the board itself the ports are
well positioned making it easy to get at everything, although like the Pi
it's all at right angles along the different edges. This can be annoying if
you want to tidy it away. On a plus power and ethernet are on the same side
so if that's all you need it is tidy. (They're on opposite sides on the Pi.)</p>

<p>The absolute number one thing going for this board though? One word: NAS.
The onboard SATA gives you scope to do a lot more than normal. I think it'd
be worth it just for that. I also think the infrared port could be a lot of
fun, and there are probably some interesting applications with the audio in.
Are these extras enough to really justify the extra price? The board still
is hacky. More so than the Pi I feel, but not as bad as the BeagleBoard. It's
hard to say, but there are indeed things to do with the Cubieboard.</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="dreamplug"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-5."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">5. </span>DreamPlug</h1>

<p>The DreamPlug is polished - at least on the outside. It's router sized and
is cased similarly, although the casing actually feels more robust than a
typical router. It's an impressive solid feel. Unlike a router the DreamPlug
is filled with lots of IO though. SD, eSATA, S/PDIF &amp; 1/8&quot; jacks, USB, and
the crown jewel I think, dual gigabit ethernet ports. All of this essentially
makes it a proper low power server.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the devices, the DreamPlug we've got shipped proper with
Debian 6.0 Squeeze, which means out of the box we've only got to concern
ourselves with logging in before we can start doing. No extra writing to SD
card, although that can be done if you want. Unfortunately, logging in can be
a bit of a trick - there's no display after all. The first time I turned it
on I couldn't work out what was going on. It was necessary to 
<a class="cow-url" href="http://dreamplug.googlecode.com/files/DreamPlug-User%20Guide_US_v1.2-Aug-28-2012.pdf">connect the little JTAG USB&lt;-&gt;serial adapter</a> to see what was happening.</p>

<p>Some fun and games with minicom and we're in business. The default setup of
Debian here is to setup the onboard Wifi as an acesspoint, with an IP address
of 192.168.1.1. This nicely conflicted with my router's address of
192.168.1.254. Commenting out a line in /etc/rc.local disables that and I
could finally get things into a usable state. The DreamPlug I think turns out
to be kind of fun like this. Instead of fiddling around with hardware it's
almost straight up Linux hacking. I think you'll need to be compentent at the
command line or at least wanting to learn to really get things done.</p>

<p>Once you surmount that little command line hurdle though, you're in business
with something you can really use. The system has a snappy response and
there's a site,
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.spinifex.com.au/plugs/dplugintro.html">Spinifex</a>, with some good
directions to help you navigate through the oddities of the Debian setup on
the DreamPlug. It's a bit out of date, but still useful. More of this fun
Linux hacking reinterpreting the directions. Overall I think the DreamPlug
makes a perfect step up from an OpenWRT router. You want more power and
flexibility in what you do on your LAN or want to run some more major
services, like a proper file server. (Yes, you can do this with some OpenWRT
routers, but I would not consider 2 MB/s to be proper.)</p>


<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->

<p><a name="minipc"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-6."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">6. </span>MK802 Mini PC</h1>

<p>Immediately, the Mini PC has one thing going for it. It's size. It's an order
of magnitude smaller than any of the other systems we're looking at here and
it's in a case to boot. That makes it devilishly easy to transport. It ships
with Android 4(.X?) which means you boot into a familiar interface. However,
it is also armed with a microSD card slot which with the help of
<a class="cow-url" href="https://www.miniand.com/forums/forums/2/topics/1">disk images</a> lets it run
standard Ubuntu Linux and derivatives. Just write the image to a card, pop it
in to the slot, and it turns the Mini PC into something more directly
comparable with the other systems.</p>

<p>I've loaded up the Lubuntu 1GB 1080p image and everything I've tested has
worked out of the box. It is slow though. I originally tried the Ubuntu image
but found it to be pretty much unusable. Really slow and a DNS resolution bug
which would need to be manually fixed. Lubuntu manages OK but it's just slow.
I suspect most of this slow down is due to running regular desktop software,
while in comparison the Pi runs a more stripped down system. I also think
it's running softfloat rather than hardfloat, which is what Rasbian is
especially compiled for. Effectively this means there are calculations which
could be sped up but which aren't.</p>

<p>Hardware wise, having only 1 USB port is a bit annoying as well as you really
need a hub to get things up and running normally. This goes right along with
the special AC adapter needed to power it. Fortuantely, the onboard Wifi is
a redeeming feature in this respect meaning that there aren't any more extra
cables to deal with. Unfortunately though the onboard wifi seems to cap out at
about 50 KB/s. I had this problem under the original Android as well.</p>

<p>Lubuntu comes with sshd enabled so after setting up Wifi the first time you
can actually get away with completely remote access. That along with its case
means you can more or less leave it plugged into a wall pretty much anywhere
and have a box for running small stuff on. I think it'd be perfect for
running irssi (IRC client) inside of a screen on.</p>

<p><a name="tonido"></a></p><a class="cow-section-anchor" name="section-9."></a><h1 class="cow-heading"><span class="cow-sec-number">9. </span>TonidoPlug2</h1>

<p>In some aspects the TonidoPlug is one of the most interesting bits of
hardware we have for testing because it's really designed more as appliance
instead of a general purpose computing device. It's essentially a NAS device.
The idea is that you pop in an internal 2.5&quot; SATA disk or connect a USB hard
drive and serve the files off it. As a result all it's got is the SATA bay,
ethernet port, wifi, and a USB port. There's no debug interface &mdash; it's a
purpose built SheevaPlug. That puts it (roughly) in the same family of
devices as the DreamPlug of above.</p>

<p>What definetely is in the same class is that the TonidoPlug ships with a
stripped down Debian Squeeze with special TonidoPlug software on top of it
for management. Remember, think appliance. That's not to say that you can't
mess around with it, it's just not recommended to. The onboard 512 MB flash
doesn't leave much space. Fortunately it can boot off of other devices so,
I've set it up to run off the
<a class="cow-url" href="http://www.tonido.com/communitywiki/doku.php?id=advanceduses:usbboot">SATA disk</a>.</p>

<p>Also like the DreamPlug the TonidoPlug is really more of an excercise in
Linux hacking. The directions for setting up the SATA disk are straight
forward, but I did hit a few minor issues along the way which really confirms
it for me. What you've got then is something that in essence &quot;just works&quot; but
that you can fiddle with if you want. The fiddling isn't required. As
something to play with that really gives you options. What those are depends
on how powerful the hardware is in the end. It's very simple but it's in a
pretty slick case. You can move it easily but I'm not sure why you'd want to.
The power is a mains input which means you're tied down through that, but it
removes the complexity of an adapter too.</p>

<p>In the end I think I see the TonidoPlug best used for exactly what it says on
the tin - serving files. You just get a bit more control. Want to do it with
apache? Can do. Samba? NFS? Anything with Linux can be done. The neatest
scenario I think is to use the built-in DLNA server to create a centralized
media store. Then put a Pi with XBMC on every TV in the house that doesn't
already support DLNA. A neat little setup...</p>
